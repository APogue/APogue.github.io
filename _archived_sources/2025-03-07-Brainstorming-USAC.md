This file is under administrative calls for attention, a lack of administrative attention can make students feel unsafe. 

 NSJP Conference in 2018 to CAC and USAC shift to Eli Tsives to social media to backlash

### Jewish Students Call for Administrative Help from UCLA - the Call Goes Unanswered 

- When USAC began excluding it was clear they were compromised 

	- Jewish students called out the exclusion (winter)

	- It goes against school policy to exclude

	- Jewish students pay student fees, USAC uses these fees 

- Evidence against (CAC) continued to pile up, how much needed to accumulate? (flashback to post-Oct 7th incident)

	- X posts

	- Hostile environment by totality of circumstances 

- Jewish students had to take it upon themselves; it was clear that CAC was compromised when verdugo stepped down

	- But they called for her impeachment earlier (petition)

	- It was an impeachable offense to be in the encampment

	- Based on no condemnations by USAC for any antisemitic behavior on campus, or for blockading or any behavior breaking the rules, it was clear they weren't going to address issues 

	- Yet Jewish students didn't manage to begin the hearing process until the following academic year, after Verdugo had been voted in again by the student body 

		- Jewish students don't even have the representation necessary to change voting outcomes

		- Why are such extreme measures necessary when behavior is clearly violating policy? 

- The university didn't bother to weed out bad apples, which served to inflame tensions between student factions (Eli Tsives, who mentioned Verdugo by name) 

	- While at the same time, before the riots, no counterprotesters were addressed, putting ALL protesting students in serious danger 

- After the riots, the university chose to single out and pursue charges against specific rioters (who social media and CNN made the effort to ID)

	- Even then, charges against the hoodie guy, could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (his charges were lowered to misdemeanor I think, need to follow up on that)

	- That amounts to approximately five people, out of hundreds who showed up with weapons, fireworks, and contributed to violence and harassment 

- Did all protesting students have this coming? 

	- The person's quote saying that the encampment "had it coming"

(source on law suits and task force reports page) The Committee on Education and the Workforce report does makes references to actual occurrences and cites credible sources (some are politically right-wing but the incidents are credible). Based on how well known USAC and CAC's activity was---Shapiro, the US government, etc. all aware of their activity, it is surprising that they never even attempted to address the associated issues that arose as a result of CAC/USAC's public stance on the October incidents (and beyond). 

Why did Block so willingly chastise the encampment for Jewish "fear" rather than cite the rules that were broken and state an actionable path to either ensure the encampment was functioning in line with campus policy or to disperse and shut it down entirely?

The rules around free speech are fear-agnostic. If rules are broken the violation must be cited explicitly. It is incumbent on the administration to separately address and ameliorate fear that stems from rhetoric, activity, or incidents on campus, for reasons that are two-fold. 1. By totality of circumstances, does the fear meet the Title VI harassment and discrimination standard such that the behavior in question is no longer protected by 1A? 2. Should it not be a policy of the administration to *consistently* address incidents that may inflame tensions or impact student morale? Why when CAC and USAC were partaking in speech that clearly upset Jewish students, did the university not move to address student concerns? And why when CAC and USAC were in breach of campus policy, did the university not immediately state the policy violation and put an end to the offending behavior? 

As the oversight body and mediator, the lack of action taken by the university sought to inflame tensions between students. Then the incorrect action taken when tensions were high, lead to unsafe conditions and violence. 

What is the real fear here? That the students get along? Or that there is some level of harmony on campus should the rules be carried out as intended? Is that the fear, the policy implications of a properly functioning campus? It is not the responsibility of the administration to manufacture hostility on false pretenses. If this is the state of the world, let them learn it there. Unless it is their intention to release hostile individuals on an already disharmonious world, such that US foreign policy and the goepolitical state of this world remains the same.
