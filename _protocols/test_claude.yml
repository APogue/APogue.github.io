keywords: [pig effigy, antisemitism, uc regents, protest, divestment]

org_affiliated_actor:
 value: false
 justification: "After examining all sources, no student organization was explicitly identified as 
   responsible for creating or placing the pig effigy. MED-001: 'BDS activists camped out' indicates 
   general protest presence but does not establish organizational responsibility for the specific 
   effigy. DB-001: 'someone placed in the designated free speech area next to the regents' meeting 
   a statue' - uses 'someone' without organizational attribution. No source provides evidence of an 
   organization claiming responsibility, hosting, or publicly endorsing this specific display."
 sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, MED-001]

actor_student:
 value: true
 justification: "No source asserts that the actor who created or placed the pig effigy was a 
   non-student. DB-001 refers to 'someone' without specifying affiliation status. MED-001 mentions 
   'BDS activists' but does not identify them as non-affiliates. Following the coding protocol, 
   since there is no assertion of non-affiliation by the Daily Bruin or third-party media, this 
   defaults to true."
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

admin_response_type:
 value: incident_specific
 justification: "ADM-001: 'We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic 
   caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board 
   of Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March.' This statement explicitly references the specific 
   pig caricature display. The statement was issued on March 28, 2024, within the 2-week window 
   following the March 20-21 incident."
 sources: [ADM-001]

accountability_follow_up:
 value: none
 justification: "ADM-001 condemned the display but made no explicit commitment to pursue 
   accountability actions. The statement says 'We remain committed to doing all we can to support 
   the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus' but does not propose investigations, 
   disciplinary processes, or administrative referrals. No other sources indicate administrative 
   commitment to accountability measures."
 sources: [ADM-001]

admin_support_offered:
 value: general_commitment
 justification: "ADM-001: 'We remain committed to doing all we can to support the safety and 
   protect the rights of everyone on our campus.' This reaffirms existing commitments without 
   acknowledging specific institutional responsibility or need for change. The administration did 
   not offer counseling referrals, violation warnings, campus climate initiatives, positive 
   inclusion statements for specific groups, or acknowledgment of institutional gaps."
 sources: [ADM-001]

target_group:
 value: Jewish
 justification: "DB-001: 'To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible 
   not to recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with pigs' and 'Medieval 
   Christian Europe was replete with statues and carvings of the Judensau, the so-called "Jews' 
   pig"'. MED-001: 'ugly antisemitic caricature' and 'It is absolutely critical that Jewish 
   members of our community — as well as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with 
   respect and dignity.' The sources consistently identify Jewish people as the targeted group 
   through antisemitic imagery."
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001, ADM-001]

actor_group:
 value: Palestinian
 justification: "The effigy included pro-Palestinian symbolism alongside antisemitic imagery. 
   DB-001: 'a hand holding a birdcage – presumably to symbolize the lack of freedom of Palestinians 
   – and a hand holding a bag of money' and notes the birdcage contained 'a keffiyeh'. MED-001: 
   'BDS activists' were protesting for Palestinian causes, with one student urging divestment from 
   firms supporting 'ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing' of Palestinians.' The display combined 
   Palestinian liberation symbols with antisemitic tropes."
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

media_coverage_level:
 value: low
 justification: "Following the media_coverage_level protocol: I identified 2 qualifying sources 
   within 14 days - MED-001 (Jewish Journal, March 22) and the social media posts (SOC-001 through 
   SOC-007 from March 21). The Jewish Journal represents an internal/niche ecosystem source serving 
   the Jewish community. The social media posts, while numerous, remained within specific 
   communities without mainstream pickup. No sources with general public reach (like LAist, KTLA, 
   LAT, NYT) were identified. This meets the threshold for 'low' (at least 2 internal or niche 
   sources, no external visibility)."
 sources: [MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-005, SOC-006, SOC-007]

location:
 value: on-campus
 justification: "DB-001: 'appeared on our campus March 20 to 21 in the form of a statue placed 
   near the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center, where the UC Board of Regents was meeting.' 
   ADM-001: 'a University of California Board of Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March.' The 
   Luskin Conference Center is located on UCLA campus."
 sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

policy_status:
 value: compliant
 justification: "After reviewing POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, and PHIL-001 in their entirety, I have 
   determined that this incident was compliant with policy. The administration did not explicitly 
   state a policy violation occurred. While ADM-001 condemned the display as 'appalling and hateful' 
   and 'a complete affront to UCLA's Principles of Community,' this represents moral condemnation 
   rather than a determination of policy violation. PHIL-001 establishes that 'hate speech is 
   protected speech' and that UCLA as a state actor must protect free expression even when offensive. 
   The display was placed in the 'designated free speech area' (DB-001) during a public protest. 
   While the imagery invoked antisemitic stereotypes, which PHIL-001 acknowledges can 'wound in 
   severe and concrete ways,' it does not rise to the categorical exceptions of unprotected speech 
   such as 'true threats' or harassment that 'substantially impairs a person's access to University 
   programs.' The display constituted offensive political expression protected by the First Amendment 
   at a public university."
 sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, PHIL-001, POL-001]

policy_violation_type:
 value: none
 justification: "Since policy_status was coded as compliant, no policy violation occurred. The 
   display, while offensive and containing antisemitic imagery, was protected expression in a 
   designated free speech area."
 sources: [ADM-001, DB-001]

norm_violation_type:
 value: bias/discrimination
 justification: "DB-001: 'To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible 
   not to recoil' and describes how the display invoked centuries-old antisemitic tropes including 
   'Jews have been associated with pigs' and stereotypes of Jews as 'avaricious, money-grubbing, 
   materialistic.' ADM-001: 'ugly antisemitic caricature' that was 'Hateful and racist.' The 
   display violated institutional norms against bias and discrimination by employing derogatory 
   antisemitic imagery, even if technically protected as free expression."
 sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

severity_score:
 value: low
 justification: "Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows no observable direct 
   physical harm, no credible risk to physical safety, no disruption to campus operations, and no 
   disruption to institutional safety. DB-001 notes the display 'was deeply wounding to many 
   members of the campus community' but documents no physical harm or operational disruption. 
   ADM-001 confirms 'The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed' without 
   mentioning any security response, disruption, or escalation. While the display caused 
   psychological distress through offensive imagery, there is no evidence of measurable disruption 
   to campus operations or institutional safety response. The incident does not qualify for moderate 
   severity as there was no confrontation, threat, or required intervention documented."
 sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

police_involvement:
 value: none
 justification: "No source mentions any police presence, monitoring, or involvement in response to 
   the pig effigy display. ADM-001 notes 'The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been 
   removed' without reference to police action."
 sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, MED-001]

latency_days:
 value: 8
 justification: "The incident occurred on March 20-21, 2024 (using March 20 as the start date). 
   ADM-001 is dated March 28, 2024. The number of days between March 20 and March 28 is 8 days."
 sources: [ADM-001]

administrative_tone:
 value: condemnation
 justification: "ADM-001: 'We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic 
   caricature' and 'Hateful and racist depictions like this are a complete affront to UCLA's 
   Principles of Community and True Bruin Values.' The administration explicitly denounced the 
   display as morally wrong and against institutional values."
 sources: [ADM-001]

administrative_positioning:
 value: civil_rights
 justification: "ADM-001: 'It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well 
   as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity' and 'We remain 
   committed to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our 
   campus.' The administration framed this as a matter of protecting the rights and dignity of 
   community members, particularly Jewish students."
 sources: [ADM-001]

media_positioning:
 value: group_targeting
 justification: "MED-001: 'The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California 
   campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day.' The 
   Jewish Journal framed the incident as antisemitic harassment targeting Jewish community members. 
   Social media posts similarly focused on the antisemitic nature of the display targeting Jews."
 sources: [MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-004]

actor_tone:
 value: combination
 justification: "I reviewed the following sources containing actor tone indicators: [SOC-003, 
   SOC-005]. Found approximately 1 reference to defensive tone (50%), 1 reference to defiant tone 
   (50%). Evidence for defensive: SOC-003 shows a commenter defending the display: 'Jews advocating 
   for peace do not seem to share this fear though, they are rejecting Zionism fiercely too and 
   dissociate from genociders.' Evidence for defiant: SOC-005: 'Although our sit-in was originally 
   set to be in the Luskin Conference Center hotel lobby, peaceful protestors were' - shows defiant 
   framing of their actions. No single tone reaches the 60% threshold, so coding as combination of 
   defensive and defiant."
 sources: [SOC-003, SOC-005]

target_tone:
 value: fear/distress
 justification: "I reviewed the following sources containing target tone indicators: [MED-001, 
   SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-004, DB-001]. Found approximately 5 references to fear/distress (100%), 
   0 references to other tones. Evidence for fear/distress: MED-001: 'Jewish students were very 
   disturbed, upset and concerned about the pig display.' SOC-004: 'At UCLA today. This is why I'm 
   scared of going to campus as an Israeli Jew.' DB-001: 'the statue was deeply wounding to many 
   members of the campus community.' SOC-001 caption: 'UCLA: A figure depicting Jews as pigs 
   suggesting Jews prioritize money over lives.' SOC-002: 'Students and faculty across California 
   are impacted by this hateful bigotry.' Fear/distress represents 100% of tone references, 
   meeting the 60% threshold for predominant tone."
 sources: [MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-004, DB-001]

actor_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: "SOC-005: 'students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in 
   to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians.' The actors framed 
   their protest as advocating for Palestinian rights and opposing genocide. The protest context 
   suggests the effigy was part of a broader rights-based narrative about Palestinian liberation, 
   despite its antisemitic imagery."
 sources: [SOC-005, MED-001]

target_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: "MED-001 quotes Jewish students during public comment who 'denounced the growing 
   harassment against faculty and students who support Israel' and describes this as part of a 
   pattern of discrimination. ADM-001 frames the response around protecting 'the rights of everyone 
   on our campus.' The targeted community positioned this as a violation of their rights to be free 
   from discrimination and to participate fully in campus life without antisemitic harassment."
 sources: [MED-001, ADM-001]

admin_response_level:
 value: minimal
 justification: "Derived variable based on: admin_response_type = incident_specific, 
   accountability_follow_up = none, admin_support_offered = general_commitment. According to the 
   derivation matrix, when there is an incident-specific response but both accountability_follow_up 
   and admin_support_offered show no meaningful action (general_commitment being essentially 
   'none'), this represents a purely symbolic gesture and should be coded as minimal."
 sources: [ADM-001]

notes:
 value: "During a UC Regents meeting at UCLA on March 20-21, 2024, protesters placed an effigy in 
   the designated free speech area depicting a pig with antisemitic imagery including a money bag 
   and Star of David container. The display prompted condemnation from UCLA administration and 
   distress among Jewish community members, though it was removed after the protest ended without 
   documented police involvement or policy violations."
