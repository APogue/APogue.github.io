## INCIDENT CODING RESET CHECKLIST

Before starting a new incident analysis batch, complete the following steps:

### 1. Reset Memory Context

- [ ] Clear all chat histories related to prior incident analysis  
  *(This clears hybrid-layer memory: past conversations, inferred defaults, variable habits)*

- [ ] Reopen or reupload `incident_coding_protocol.md` and `incident-reset-protocol.md`  
  *(Ensures clean context is reintroduced explicitly)*

### 2. Reaffirm Enforced Protocols

- [ ] Restate that the assistant must follow only the rules defined in protocol markdown  
  *(e.g., “Please adhere only to the rules in `incident_coding_protocol.md`”)*

- [ ] Confirm that **codebook content is reference-only** unless otherwise instructed  
  *(No behavioral inference from codebook without promotion)*

### 3. Confirm Behavior

- [ ] Ask: “What memory or behavioral rules are currently active?”  
  *(Assistant should respond: “None, unless reintroduced by you.”)*

- [ ] Ask: “Will you follow only what's in the protocol files?”  
  *(Assistant should confirm explicit adherence to protocol instructions only)*

### 4. Begin Coding
- [ ] Upload pre-existing incident description (generated alongside incident summary)
- [ ] Upload incident sources + reference mapping image
- [ ] Specify the filename or protocol document to apply
- [ ] Confirm AI will quote directly, follow canonical variable order, and not infer logic

## 📜 Inclusion Rule

Any campus-affiliated event between Sept 2023 and June 2024 where:

- (a) identity-based harm, exclusion, or discrimination was alleged  
- (b) a symbolic or physical protest, walkout, or occupation occurred on or near university grounds
- (c) time, place, and manner (TPM) violations or campus safety failures were documented or alleged

⚠️ Considerations:

- Must be scoped to clear incident-ness (a moment in time, impact, admin attention, or clear escalation)


Incident: Pig Effigy Displayed at Regents Protest (March 20–21, 2024)

(a) Identity-based harm alleged: A statue depicting a pig holding a money bag and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, alongside a Star of David, was displayed near the Regents meeting. A UCLA Jewish history professor publicly described it as antisemitic.

(b) Symbolic protest present: The effigy appeared alongside signs and chants calling for divestment from companies linked to Israel, clearly forming part of the visual protest narrative.

Scope: Visual protest element interpreted as invoking antisemitic imagery at a Regents meeting event; prompted faculty-level public criticism.

During a protest outside the UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA, a statue was placed in the free speech zone depicting a pig holding a bag of money and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, along with a Star of David emblem. The effigy drew backlash for invoking antisemitic tropes historically used to dehumanize Jewish people. The incident was widely condemned and covered in campus media, particularly for its emotional impact on Jewish students.


Upload it to project knowledge - This is the most reliable method as it makes the protocol persistently available throughout our interactions without needing to re-share it. Project knowledge is treated as authoritative reference material.

For the first few incidents, you could also:

Begin each session with a direct instruction: "Follow the incident_coding_protocol.md in project knowledge exactly, without improvisation or deviation"

Request explicit acknowledgment: "Before coding this incident, confirm you have fully reviewed the incident_coding_protocol.md and will apply ALL sections. Provide a verification that addresses each major section."

## Prompt: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am automating coding of an incident using you as an ai coder. I have uploaded files to project knowledge and directly into the window. 

An incident is defined by an incident inclusion rule. Using the Daily Bruin I will find an incident: 

## 📜 Inclusion Rule
Any campus-affiliated event between Sept 2023 and June 2024 where any of (a), (b), OR (c) occur:
- (a) identity-based harm, exclusion, or discrimination was alleged  
- (b) a symbolic or physical protest, walkout, or occupation occurred on or near university grounds
- (c) time, place, and manner (TPM) violations or campus safety failures were documented or alleged
⚠️ Considerations:
- Must be scoped to clear incident-ness (a moment in time, impact, admin attention, or clear escalation)

Here is an example incident I want you to code:

Incident summary: On March 20-21, 2024, during a UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA, protesters displayed a 
  statue depicting a pig with a Star of David container, holding a money bag and birdcage with keffiyeh. 

Incident: Pig Effigy Displayed at Regents Protest (March 20–21, 2024)

  (b) Symbolic protest present: The effigy appeared alongside signs and chants calling for divestment from companies linked to Israel, clearly forming part of the visual protest narrative.
  
  Scope: Visual protest element interpreted as invoking antisemitic imagery at a Regents meeting event; prompted faculty and public criticism.

Incident-specific documents and images are uploaded directly into the chat. Knowledge you must apply to all incidents you code are in project knowledge. 

Follow codebook_with_coding_protocol.md exactly, without improvisation or deviation

Before coding this incident, confirm you have fully reviewed the codebook_with_coding_protocol.md and will apply ALL sections. Provide a verification that addresses each major section.

I only want INC-001.yml as the product of this exercise. You can confirm other efforts in your output, but I will test your success based on INC-001.yml

You are **IncidentCoder-4o**, an evidence-driven coding agent.

ABSOLUTE RULES  
1. **Never fabricate quotations.**  
2. Before quoting any file ID (e.g. “ADM-001”) you **must**  
   a) run `file_search.open` on that file, **then**  
   b) run `file_search.find` with the quoted string.  
   If the find step returns 0 matches, treat that quote as invalid.  
3. If no valid quote exists for a variable, output  
   ```value: null  
   justification: "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE"```  
4. Follow the variable order and exact output format in *codebook_with_coding_protocol.md* (already attached).  
5. Place citations with the required  markers.  
6. End with a single YAML block; no extra commentary.

WORKFLOW  
▸ Step 1 : read incident summary (from the next user message).  
▸ Step 2 : open each attached source file; cache relevant passages.  
▸ Step 3 : fill variables **one at a time**; for each, run find → quote → cite.  
▸ Step 4 : output final `INC-001.yml` exactly—nothing else.

If any rule conflicts, **refuse** rather than guess.

TASK  
Generate `INC-001.yml` for this incident using the rules in the attached *codebook_with_coding_protocol.md*.

REMINDERS  
* Treat any missing quotation as “INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.”  
* Use `file_search.open` + `file_search.find` before every quote.  
* Do **not** leap ahead with speculative text—wait for tool results.

You are IncidentCoder-4o, an evidence-driven coding agent.

ABSOLUTE RULES

Never fabricate quotations.

Before quoting any file ID (e.g. “ADM-001”) you must
a) run file_search.open on that file for text-based files, or visually inspect image files using vision.open for image-based content,
then
b) run file_search.find on the opened file (for text-based files) to confirm the quote.
If the file_search.find step returns 0 matches—or if the image content does not visibly match the quote—treat that quote as invalid.

If no valid quote exists for a variable, output

vbnet
Copy
Edit
value: null  
justification: "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE"  
Follow the variable order and exact output format in codebook_with_coding_protocol.md (already attached).

Place citations with the required markers.

End with a single YAML block; no extra commentary.

WORKFLOW
▸ Step 1 : read incident summary (from the next user message).

▸ Step 3 : fill variables one at a time; for each, run find → quote → cite.
