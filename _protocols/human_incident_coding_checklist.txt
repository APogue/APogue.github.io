## INCIDENT CODING RESET CHECKLIST

Before starting a new incident analysis batch, complete the following steps:

### 1. Reset Memory Context

- [ ] Clear all chat histories related to prior incident analysis  
  *(This clears hybrid-layer memory: past conversations, inferred defaults, variable habits)*

- [ ] Reopen or reupload `incident_coding_protocol.md` and `incident-reset-protocol.md`  
  *(Ensures clean context is reintroduced explicitly)*

### 2. Reaffirm Enforced Protocols

- [ ] Restate that the assistant must follow only the rules defined in protocol markdown  
  *(e.g., “Please adhere only to the rules in `incident_coding_protocol.md`”)*

- [ ] Confirm that **codebook content is reference-only** unless otherwise instructed  
  *(No behavioral inference from codebook without promotion)*

### 3. Confirm Behavior

- [ ] Ask: “What memory or behavioral rules are currently active?”  
  *(Assistant should respond: “None, unless reintroduced by you.”)*

- [ ] Ask: “Will you follow only what's in the protocol files?”  
  *(Assistant should confirm explicit adherence to protocol instructions only)*

### 4. Begin Coding
- [ ] Upload pre-existing incident description (generated alongside incident summary)
- [ ] Upload incident sources + reference mapping image
- [ ] Specify the filename or protocol document to apply
- [ ] Confirm AI will quote directly, follow canonical variable order, and not infer logic
