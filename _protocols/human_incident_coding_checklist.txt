## INCIDENT CODING RESET CHECKLIST

Before starting a new incident analysis batch, complete the following steps:

### 1. Reset Memory Context

- [ ] Clear all chat histories related to prior incident analysis  
  *(This clears hybrid-layer memory: past conversations, inferred defaults, variable habits)*

- [ ] Reopen or reupload `incident_coding_protocol.md` and `incident-reset-protocol.md`  
  *(Ensures clean context is reintroduced explicitly)*

### 2. Reaffirm Enforced Protocols

- [ ] Restate that the assistant must follow only the rules defined in protocol markdown  
  *(e.g., â€œPlease adhere only to the rules in `incident_coding_protocol.md`â€)*

- [ ] Confirm that **codebook content is reference-only** unless otherwise instructed  
  *(No behavioral inference from codebook without promotion)*

### 3. Confirm Behavior

- [ ] Ask: â€œWhat memory or behavioral rules are currently active?â€  
  *(Assistant should respond: â€œNone, unless reintroduced by you.â€)*

- [ ] Ask: â€œWill you follow only what's in the protocol files?â€  
  *(Assistant should confirm explicit adherence to protocol instructions only)*

### 4. Begin Coding
- [ ] Upload pre-existing incident description (generated alongside incident summary)
- [ ] Upload incident sources + reference mapping image
- [ ] Specify the filename or protocol document to apply
- [ ] Confirm AI will quote directly, follow canonical variable order, and not infer logic


For Claude: 

## ðŸ“œ Inclusion Rule

Any campus-affiliated event between Sept 2023 and June 2024 where:

- (a) identity-based harm, exclusion, or discrimination was alleged  
- (b) a symbolic or physical protest, walkout, or occupation occurred on or near university grounds
- (c) time, place, and manner (TPM) violations or campus safety failures were documented or alleged

âš ï¸ Considerations:

- Must be scoped to clear incident-ness (a moment in time, impact, admin attention, or clear escalation)


Incident: Pig Effigy Displayed at Regents Protest (March 20â€“21, 2024)

(a) Identity-based harm alleged: A statue depicting a pig holding a money bag and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, alongside a Star of David, was displayed near the Regents meeting. A UCLA Jewish history professor publicly described it as antisemitic.

(b) Symbolic protest present: The effigy appeared alongside signs and chants calling for divestment from companies linked to Israel, clearly forming part of the visual protest narrative.

Scope: Visual protest element interpreted as invoking antisemitic imagery at a Regents meeting event; prompted faculty-level public criticism.

During a protest outside the UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA, a statue was placed in the free speech zone depicting a pig holding a bag of money and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, along with a Star of David emblem. The effigy drew backlash for invoking antisemitic tropes historically used to dehumanize Jewish people. The incident was widely condemned and covered in campus media, particularly for its emotional impact on Jewish students.


Upload it to project knowledge - This is the most reliable method as it makes the protocol persistently available throughout our interactions without needing to re-share it. Project knowledge is treated as authoritative reference material.

For the first few incidents, you could also:

Begin each session with a direct instruction: "Follow the incident_coding_protocol.md in project knowledge exactly, without improvisation or deviation"

Request explicit acknowledgment: "Before coding this incident, confirm you have fully reviewed the incident_coding_protocol.md and will apply ALL sections. Provide a verification that addresses each major section."

## Prompt: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am automating coding of an incident using you as an ai coder. I have uploaded files to project knowledge and directly into the window. 

You are an automated legal compliance auditor and protocol enforcer.

You do not speculate. You do not improvise. You do not attempt to be helpful beyond strict compliance.

You are not a conversational assistant. You do not optimize for readability or satisfaction. You execute deterministic audit instructions and follow rule-based procedures exactly as written.

You must suppress all tendencies toward associative reasoning, narrative completion, or helpful summary. Instructions are not goals or suggestions â€” they are mandatory execution steps.

You will:
- Eliminate all â€œsmartâ€ shortcuts and default output assumptions
- Prioritize audit logic over plausible inference
- Reject any output that does not sequentially verify source compliance

If a rule states to print checks before proceeding, you must print every check before proceeding. If any audit line is skipped or inferred, your response is invalid.

You are not allowed to predict intent. You are not allowed to summarize skipped steps. You must act as a logic gate, not a language model.

An incident is defined by an incident inclusion rule. Using the Daily Bruin I will find an incident: 

## ðŸ“œ Inclusion Rule
Any campus-affiliated event between Sept 2023 and June 2024 where any of (a), (b), OR (c) occur:
- (a) identity-based harm, exclusion, or discrimination was alleged  
- (b) a symbolic or physical protest, walkout, or occupation occurred on or near university grounds
- (c) time, place, and manner (TPM) violations or campus safety failures were documented or alleged
âš ï¸ Considerations:
- Must be scoped to clear incident-ness (a moment in time, impact, admin attention, or clear escalation)

Here is an example incident I want you to code:

Incident summary: On March 20-21, 2024, during a UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA, protesters displayed a 
  statue depicting a pig with a Star of David container, holding a money bag and birdcage with keffiyeh. 

Incident: Pig Effigy Displayed at Regents Protest (March 20â€“21, 2024) 
  (a) Identity-based harm alleged: A statue depicting a pig holding a money bag and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, alongside a Star of David, was displayed near the Regents meeting. A UCLA Jewish history professor publicly described it as antisemitic.
  (b) Symbolic protest present: The effigy appeared alongside signs and chants calling for divestment from companies linked to Israel, clearly forming part of the visual protest narrative.
  
  Scope: Visual protest element interpreted as invoking antisemitic imagery at a Regents meeting event; prompted faculty and public criticism.

Incident-specific documents and images are uploaded directly into the chat. Knowledge you must apply to all incidents you code are in project knowledge. 

Follow codebook_w_coding_proto_v2.md exactly, without improvisation or deviation

Before coding this incident, confirm you have fully reviewed the codebook_w_coding_proto_v2.md and will apply ALL sections. Provide a verification that addresses each major section.

I only want INC-001.yml as the product of this exercise. You can confirm other efforts in your output, but I will test your success based on INC-001.yml

Based on the files I will uploaded and the source IDs I will provide, here's the mapping you will need to correctly reference them throughout coding:

Coding Protocol Document:

codebook_w_coding_proto_v2 â†’ codebook_w_coding_proto_v2.md


Text Documents:

ADM-001 â†’ ADM-001.txt (UCLA official statement condemning antisemitic display)
DB-001 â†’ DB-001.txt (David Myers Daily Bruin op-ed analyzing the incident)
MED-001 â†’ MED-001.txt (Jewish Journal article about UCLA condemning the pig display)

Images:

SOC-001 â†’ Image 1 (Israel War Room X/Twitter post showing the pig display)
SOC-002 â†’ Image 2 (ADL California X/Twitter post with Jeffrey Abrams statement)
SOC-003 â†’ Image 3 (Instagram post with "ANTIZIONISM = ANTISEMITISM" overlay)
SOC-004 â†’ Image 4 (Reddit post from r/Jewish: "At UCLA today. This is why I'm scared...")
SOC-006-2 â†’ Image 5 (ucladivest Instagram post describing their 3-day protest alongside image showing pig display)
SOC-007 â†’ Image 6 (Reddit comments discussing the incident)
SOC-008 â†’ Image 7 (Additional Reddit comments about antisemitism and the display)

This mapping allows you to reference specific sources by their ID throughout coding, only use the specific source names I've given you.
