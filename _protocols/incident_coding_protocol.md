If I'm building a system for rigorous research auditability, version control, and multi-agent consistency, then relying on hidden memory is a liability, not a feature.

## This file will include:

- The Critical Source Validation Protocol

- Variable justification rules

- Prompting conventions for AI coders (Claude, GPT, or others)

- Optional: guidance for humans using Replit, YAML editors, etc.

## What GPT will do 

- If you give me the key rules in plaintext (or markdown), I’ll:

- Structure it cleanly

- Suggest section headers

- Add YAML frontmatter if you want it GitHub-viewable as a page (layout: project_default etc.)

- Follow only what's in that file — and ignore memory overlays unless explicitly instructed

## GPT memory specific

- Export everything I’ve memorized so far for review

- Delete what you no longer want tracked in memory

- This keeps your whole project epistemically clean.

## We want global enforcement 

- Put protocols in the project instructions 

- If your goal is: “Always quote exactly before justifying, for every variable, no exceptions,” then it must go into my project instructions or model memory.

- Automatically applied, even before I open a codebook

- Cross-referenced every time I generate YAML or do variable justification

- Used whether or not you mention the protocol in the moment

- If I leave the rulesets in the codebook

	- Even though it's written there, I treat the codebook as a content reference, not as a behavioral rulebook unless you also elevate the rule into my system-level memory or are actively prompting it.
