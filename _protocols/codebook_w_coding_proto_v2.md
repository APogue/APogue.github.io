### V2 Goals

Claude is doing a fine job in some areas and ignoring instructions in others. Previous iterations of the document sought to add more text to emphasize where instructions needed to be followed. This doesn't work. Either Claude needs to be instructed in different ways, or certain areas must remain discretionary because no set of instructions will obtain the exact desired behavior. Places where this is the case should be documented. 

1. Identify which behaviors are actually controllable through instructions vs. which are judgment calls

2. Streamline protocols to focus only on trackable, auditable requirements

3. Make citation/source-checking requirements the primary enforcement mechanism

4. Remove redundant verification checklists that don't actually change behavior

5. Document where discretion is inevitable rather than pretending it can be eliminated

I want it to mimic the Citations function in the Claude API. I want transparent, trackable, auditable decisions based on direct quotes from sources. (Really I want to use the API, it might even be cheaper for me, but it would be complex and make the project unusable in general for others if that's an option I want to leave open).

1. Granular citation linking - Each claim should be directly tied to specific source content

2. Transparent sourcing - Show exactly where each piece of evidence comes from

3. Minimal but sufficient evidence - Check enough sources to support the decision, but don't over-analyze

4. Auditable methodology - Make it clear how I arrived at each conclusion

The point is to streamline the codebook_with_coding_protocol - to focus on citation requirements and evidence standards rather than trying to control subjective judgment calls through excessive rules.
