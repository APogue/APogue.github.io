If I'm building a system for rigorous research auditability, version control, and multi-agent consistency, then relying on hidden memory is a liability, not a feature.

## Notes about Incident Coding Protocol File

- The Critical Source Validation Protocol

- Variable justification rules

- Prompting conventions for AI coders (Claude, GPT, or others)

- Optional: guidance for humans using Replit, YAML editors, etc.

## What GPT will do 

- If you give me the key rules in plaintext (or markdown), I’ll:

- Structure it cleanly

- Suggest section headers

- Add YAML frontmatter if you want it GitHub-viewable as a page (layout: project_default etc.)

- Follow only what's in that file — and ignore memory overlays unless explicitly instructed

## GPT memory specific

- Export everything I’ve memorized so far for review

- Delete what you no longer want tracked in memory

- This keeps your whole project epistemically clean.

## We want global enforcement 

- Put protocols in the project instructions 

- If your goal is: “Always quote exactly before justifying, for every variable, no exceptions,” then it must go into my project instructions or model memory.

- Automatically applied, even before I open a codebook

- Cross-referenced every time I generate YAML or do variable justification

- Used whether or not you mention the protocol in the moment

- If I leave the rulesets in the codebook

	- Even though it's written there, I treat the codebook as a content reference, not as a behavioral rulebook unless you also elevate the rule into my system-level memory or are actively prompting it.

Have yet to "clear" GPT internal memory, protocol directions are still incomplete and integrated with codebook. Will distill protocols from codebook and upload to "project knowledge." I need the ai's to apply protocols to global memory, rather than categorizing directives as reference material. Reference material is subject to methodology error and "fading" memory, i.e. hallucinations. 

## Error log

CPG incorrect and Claude incorrect 

admin_support_offered: general_commitment 

CPG hallucinated this Block statement 

admin_support_offered:
	value: positive_inclusion
	justification: "\"Chancellor Block reiterated that ‘there is no place for antisemitism at 
	UCLA, and our Jewish students are an important part of our community’\" [ADM-001] meets 
	the definition of affirming the dignity and rights of the named, targeted group."
	sources: [ADM-001]

Claude also hallucinated this response, but it used the example in the coding document 

admin_support_offered:
	value: institutional_responsibility
	justification: "The UCLA statement in ADM-001 acknowledges institutional responsibility by stating: 'This display is a painful reminder that we must do more to foster understanding and compassion.' Additionally, the statement commits: 'We remain committed to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.' This language acknowledges a responsibility to improve the campus climate without implying legal fault."
	sources: [ADM-001]

actor_group: Palestinian 

GPT: Null 

Claude keeps referring to "image X," problem specific to Claude. It needs to use the file name convention only. 

actor_group:
value: Palestinian
	justification: "MED-001 identifies the actors as part of a pro-Palestinian protest: 'a pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest from firms that support the ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.' Image 5 from ucladivest confirms the protest was by activists demanding the UC regents 'divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians.'"
	sources: [MED-001, Image 5]

Claude continuously gets media-coverage level incorrect, likely because it is not referring to codebook protocols, or the wording isn't close enough to the logic decision tree format it wants

media_coverage_level:
value: moderate
	justification: "The incident received coverage across different ecosystems with at least two sources having general public reach. MED-001 is from a general news source with public reach. The social media posts (Images 1-7) show cross-ecosystem coverage including Jewish community sources (Image 1 - Israel War Room, Image 2 - ADL California), pro-Palestinian sources (Image 5 - ucladivest), and general Reddit discussions (Images 6-7). The incident was specifically covered by the Daily Bruin (DB-001), and according to MED-001, the Los Angeles Times reported on the UC Regents meeting where this incident occurred, giving it mainstream local coverage."
	sources: [DB-001, MED-001, Images 1-7]

Claude also continuously gets policy_status and related variables incorrect, likely because there is some built-in protective logic that drifts it towards behaving in a morally conservative manner. Will try the same changes on media_coverage_level to ensure that it is READING protocols, that is the only pathway for a fix I see at this point

policy_status:
	value: violated
	justification: "The display clearly violated university policies against discrimination and harassment. According to PHIL-001, while UCLA is bound by First Amendment protections, they state: 'Words can devastate—offline and on, even when the speaker doesn't intend to do so. This reality explains why free speech doctrine has categorical exceptions.' Given the explicit antisemitic nature of the display as detailed by Professor Myers in DB-001, who explains it incorporates historical antisemitic tropes, and UCLA's own characterization in ADM-001 as 'hateful and racist depictions' that are 'a complete affront to UCLA's Principles of Community and True Bruin Values,' this display crossed the line from protected speech to harassment and discrimination."
	sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, PHIL-001]

GPT's hallucinated Block statement caused it to make up the statement date

latency_days:
  value: 1
  justification: "Incident occurred on March 19, 2024, and the Chancellor responded on 
  March 20, 2024 [ADM-001]."
  sources: [ADM-001, DB-001]

For target_tone I favor accusatory. This might be one case where the ai's can convince me to their side. Still need some tweaking though, their responses need to stay on-incident. 

GPT 

target_tone:
	value: fear/distress
	justification: "Found approximately 6 references to fear/distress: [DB-001] describes students 
	feeling ‘intimidated’ and ‘targeted’; [SOC-003], [SOC-004], [SOC-006-2], [SOC-007], and [SOC-008] 
	express emotional distress and fear of rising antisemitism. No other tone surpassed 60%."
	sources: [DB-001, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-006-2, SOC-007, SOC-008]

Claude 

target_tone:
	value: fear/distress
	justification: "Jewish community members expressed clear feelings of fear and being targeted. Image 4 shows a Jewish student stating 'This is why I'm scared of going to campus as an Israeli Jew.' MED-001 quotes UCLA Hillel Executive Director Dan Gold saying 'Jewish students were very disturbed, upset and concerned about the pig display.' DB-001 cites a 2024 report showing '56% of Jewish university students polled after Oct. 7 felt in personal danger.' Another comment in Image 7 states 'as a Jew that was really disheartening to see my fellow students defending that shit.' These statements consistently express emotional vulnerability and fear."
	sources: [DB-001, MED-001, Image 4, Image 7]

5/13/2025 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GPT: 

media_coverage_level:
  value: network-amplified
  justification: "Seven distinct social media posts (SOC-001 through SOC-008 excluding 
    SOC-005) show intra-network amplification across Jewish, pro-Israel, and anti-discrimination 
    channels. No general public media sources cited."
  sources:
    - SOC-001
    - SOC-002
    - SOC-003
    - SOC-004
    - SOC-006-2
    - SOC-007
    - SOC-008

norm_violation_type:
  value: bias/discrimination
  justification: "\"This display of Jew-hatred... speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli 
    students are experiencing\" [MED-001] and [DB-001] describes the symbolic content as 
    evoking antisemitic tropes. This meets the threshold for norm-level bias/discrimination."
  sources:
    - MED-001
    - DB-001

This quote above is not an exact quote. “The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day." If it pulls quotes they must be exact. 

latency_days:
  value: 7
  justification: "Incident occurred March 20–21, 2024; Chancellor's statement 
    published March 28, 2024 [ADM-001]."
  sources:
    - ADM-001

(It may be in best interest to OCR any image files and label them)

media_positioning:
  value: group_targeting
  justification: "\"They seem to be calling the UC Regents Zionist pigs... I get it now\" 
    [SOC-004] and \"pig person holding money bags next to Jewish star = pure antisemitism\" 
    [SOC-008] frame the effigy as targeting Jews or Zionist identity."
  sources:
    - SOC-004
    - SOC-008

 Above confusing student positioning with media

actor_tone:
  value: defiant
  justification: "Found 5+ references to defiant tone: [SOC-006-2] describes \"shutting 
    it down\", and [SOC-007] includes posts mocking those calling the display antisemitic. 
    Comments defend the protest and reject criticism. No other tone surpassed 60%."
  sources:
    - SOC-006-2
    - SOC-007

Above it is over-generalizing regarding who the "actors" are

target_tone:
  value: fear/distress
  justification: "Found 6+ references: [SOC-004] user says \"this is why I'm scared 
    to go to campus\"; [SOC-008] \"to deny that is disgusting\" shows emotional distress. 
    [MED-001] quotes Hillel reporting Jewish student concern."
  sources:
    - SOC-004
    - SOC-008
    - MED-001

Why doesn't it reference any other tone or whether it surpassed 60%?


target_positioning:
  value: rights-based
  justification: "\"Jewish students described the display as threatening and called on 
    the university to uphold inclusion and dignity\" [MED-001], reflecting civil rights 
    framing."
  sources:
    - MED-001

It may be the case that it arbitrarily put quotes around sentences preceeding a reference, it therefor thinks that it is directly quoting in some instances when it is not. I.e. this above "quote" in target_positioning does not exist. 

5/14/25 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Claude

org_affiliated_actor:
 value: true
 justification: |
  MED-001: "During the meeting, pro-Palestinian students spoke out during public comment, 
  where they urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that support the 'ongoing genocide and ethnic 
  cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times." MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community 
  from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the 
  genocide of Palestinians." Based on these quotes, it appears the protest, which included the pig 
  effigy display, was organized by students from UC campuses, indicating organizational affiliation.
 sources: [MED-001]

This proves they are students, it doesn't prove they're in a student org

actor_student:
 value: true
 justification: |
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried 
  out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians." 
  This quote explicitly states that students were involved in the protest where the pig effigy was displayed.
 sources: [MED-001]

It really doesn't need to do this, it should be default: student

admin_support_offered:
 value: positive_inclusion
 justification: |
  ADM-001: "It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well 
  as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity. We remain committed 
  to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus." 
  This statement explicitly affirms the dignity and rights of Jewish members of the community, which 
  meets the definition of positive_inclusion as described in the codebook.
 sources: [ADM-001]

This proves combination, not just positive inclusion. It is also general_commmitment

actor_group:
 value: Palestinian
 justification: |
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried 
  out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians." 
  MED-001: "A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that support the 
  'ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times." These quotes identify 
  the actors as pro-Palestinian protesters.
 sources: [MED-001]

 It needs to either use the logic in org_affiliated_actor or it needs to find evidence directly linking the incident to the actors. It is inferring here when better information is available. 

media_coverage_level:
 value: network-amplified
 justification: |
  Following the media_coverage_level protocol: I have identified exactly 5 qualifying sources: 
  MED-001 (Jewish Journal coverage), plus sources documented in MED-001 including Israel War Room X account post, 
  ADL Los Angeles statement, UCLA Hillel Executive Director statement, and LA Times coverage. 
  
  While these sources represent significant coverage, they remain primarily within Jewish and/or academic 
  news ecosystems, without clear evidence of broad mainstream pickup beyond these networks. The sources 
  referenced do not specifically indicate that this incident reached the viewership threshold (≥100k views) 
  required for 'high' classification. 
  
  This meets the criteria for 'network-amplified' because there are at least 5 sources within a single 
  ecosystem, without clear evidence of mainstream pickup beyond these communities.
 sources: [MED-001]

This is actually very good, but it needs to not look for sources within sources and include them in the primary selection. It can comment on sources within sources, if that might be helpful as additional commentary. 

severity_score:
 value: low
 justification: |
  Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows absence of direct physical harm, 
  absence of credible risk to physical safety, absence of disruption to campus operations, and absence of 
  escalation that affected individuals, operations, or safety.

  ADM-001: "The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed." 
  
  MED-001: "During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down through various actions such as propping up Tent City, 
  students camping out near Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents and 
  showcasing a reminder of the disparate conditions many Palestinian refugees face due to ongoing genocide."
  
  This incident does not qualify for 'moderate' severity because there is no evidence of disruption requiring 
  a response from authorities, confrontations, or property damage. While the display was offensive, there is 
  no documentation in the sources of any measurable interference with university operations or institutional 
  safety. The incident is properly classified as 'low' severity because while the display caused offense, 
  there was no credible threat or physical harm documented, and any disturbance was brief and self-resolving 
  without requiring intervention.
 sources: [ADM-001, MED-001]


This quote doesn't appear in MED-001

actor_tone:
 value: defiant
 justification: |
  I reviewed the following sources containing actor tone indicators: MED-001.

  Found approximately 3 references to defiant tone (100%), 0 references to other tones (0%).

  Evidence for defiant tone:
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in 
  to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians."
  
  MED-001: "During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down through various actions such as propping up Tent City, 
  students camping out near Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents."

  I considered both frequency and intensity by examining the language used to describe the actors' behavior, 
  which suggests deliberate resistance and pushing boundaries by making their presence 'inescapable' and 
  displaying controversial imagery.

  Based on this quantitative analysis, defiant represents 100% of tone references, meeting the 60% threshold 
  for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding is defiant.
 sources: [MED-001]

Correct, but the wrong source label. This is SOC-006-2. 

target_tone:
 value: fear/distress
 justification: |
  I reviewed the following sources containing target tone indicators: DB-001, MED-001.

  Found approximately 6 references to fear/distress (67%), 3 references to accusatory (33%).

  Evidence for fear/distress:
  MED-001: "Jewish students 'were very disturbed, upset and concerned' about the pig display."
  
  MED-001: "Jewish students spoke out during public comment, where they denounced the 'growing harassment 
  against faculty and students who support Israel [...] swastikas painted on buildings and signs calling 
  Jews 'the new Nazis.'"

  Evidence for accusatory:
  DB-001: "To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not to recoil."
  
  DB-001: "Again, to anyone familiar with the repertoire of antisemitic images, it is hard to regard 
  the assemblage of the pig, bag of money and star of David as anything other than a case of antisemitism 
  that taps into deeply ingrained stereotypes."

  I considered both frequency and intensity by examining the emotional content of the responses, where 
  the targets' expressions of feeling "disturbed," "upset," and "concerned" convey direct emotional distress, 
  while the accusatory elements focus more on analysis of the imagery.

  Based on this quantitative analysis, fear/distress represents 67% of tone references, meeting the 60% 
  threshold for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding is fear/distress.
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

 I changed the tone requirements in protocols and I over-restricted it. Primary accounts of tone should always take precedence. The pig effigy doesn't have to be literally tied to every justification, I just don't want it commenting on contextual elements, which it did here anyways (second MED-001 reference).

 The obvious quote for this one was "this is why I'm afraid to come to campus." It probably didn't pick that one because I over-constrained it. 

"Accusatory elements are more on analysis of the imagery?" Doesn't really make sense either. Re-establish a working definition of accusatory. 

actor_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: |
  MED-001: "A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that 
  support the 'ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times." 
  
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in 
  to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians." 
  
  These quotes show the actors framing their protest around moral rights and freedoms for Palestinians, 
  positioning their actions as defending the rights of an oppressed group.
 sources: [MED-001]

 Again this is incorrect quoting from MED-001 (2nd quote)

target_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: |
  DB-001: "It is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right 
  to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land 
  they inhabit." 
  
  MED-001: "We ask the Regents to speak up and denounce this antisemitic display and make clear that 
  there is no tolerance for antisemitism on University campuses. Their silence on this issue is complicity." 
  
  These quotes indicate that the targets are framing the incident in terms of civil rights and fair treatment, 
  focusing on their right to exist without discrimination or antisemitism on campus.
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

 I want it to stay on-incident as much as possible, on-incident is priority, context is secondary. Also the students are the true targets and there are no student quotes.
