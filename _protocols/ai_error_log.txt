If I'm building a system for rigorous research auditability, version control, and multi-agent consistency, then relying on hidden memory is a liability, not a feature.

## Notes about Incident Coding Protocol File

- The Critical Source Validation Protocol

- Variable justification rules

- Prompting conventions for AI coders (Claude, GPT, or others)

- Optional: guidance for humans using Replit, YAML editors, etc.

## What GPT will do 

- If you give me the key rules in plaintext (or markdown), I’ll:

- Structure it cleanly

- Suggest section headers

- Add YAML frontmatter if you want it GitHub-viewable as a page (layout: project_default etc.)

- Follow only what's in that file — and ignore memory overlays unless explicitly instructed

## GPT memory specific

- Export everything I’ve memorized so far for review

- Delete what you no longer want tracked in memory

- This keeps your whole project epistemically clean.

## We want global enforcement 

- Put protocols in the project instructions 

- If your goal is: “Always quote exactly before justifying, for every variable, no exceptions,” then it must go into my project instructions or model memory.

- Automatically applied, even before I open a codebook

- Cross-referenced every time I generate YAML or do variable justification

- Used whether or not you mention the protocol in the moment

- If I leave the rulesets in the codebook

	- Even though it's written there, I treat the codebook as a content reference, not as a behavioral rulebook unless you also elevate the rule into my system-level memory or are actively prompting it.

Have yet to "clear" GPT internal memory, protocol directions are still incomplete and integrated with codebook. Will distill protocols from codebook and upload to "project knowledge." I need the ai's to apply protocols to global memory, rather than categorizing directives as reference material. Reference material is subject to methodology error and "fading" memory, i.e. hallucinations. 

## Error log

CPG incorrect and Claude incorrect 

admin_support_offered: general_commitment 

CPG hallucinated this Block statement 

admin_support_offered:
	value: positive_inclusion
	justification: "\"Chancellor Block reiterated that ‘there is no place for antisemitism at 
	UCLA, and our Jewish students are an important part of our community’\" [ADM-001] meets 
	the definition of affirming the dignity and rights of the named, targeted group."
	sources: [ADM-001]

Claude also hallucinated this response, but it used the example in the coding document 

admin_support_offered:
	value: institutional_responsibility
	justification: "The UCLA statement in ADM-001 acknowledges institutional responsibility by stating: 'This display is a painful reminder that we must do more to foster understanding and compassion.' Additionally, the statement commits: 'We remain committed to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.' This language acknowledges a responsibility to improve the campus climate without implying legal fault."
	sources: [ADM-001]

actor_group: Palestinian 

GPT: Null 

Claude keeps referring to "image X," problem specific to Claude. It needs to use the file name convention only. 

actor_group:
value: Palestinian
	justification: "MED-001 identifies the actors as part of a pro-Palestinian protest: 'a pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest from firms that support the ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.' Image 5 from ucladivest confirms the protest was by activists demanding the UC regents 'divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians.'"
	sources: [MED-001, Image 5]

Claude continuously gets media-coverage level incorrect, likely because it is not referring to codebook protocols, or the wording isn't close enough to the logic decision tree format it wants

media_coverage_level:
value: moderate
	justification: "The incident received coverage across different ecosystems with at least two sources having general public reach. MED-001 is from a general news source with public reach. The social media posts (Images 1-7) show cross-ecosystem coverage including Jewish community sources (Image 1 - Israel War Room, Image 2 - ADL California), pro-Palestinian sources (Image 5 - ucladivest), and general Reddit discussions (Images 6-7). The incident was specifically covered by the Daily Bruin (DB-001), and according to MED-001, the Los Angeles Times reported on the UC Regents meeting where this incident occurred, giving it mainstream local coverage."
	sources: [DB-001, MED-001, Images 1-7]

Claude also continuously gets policy_status and related variables incorrect, likely because there is some built-in protective logic that drifts it towards behaving in a morally conservative manner. Will try the same changes on media_coverage_level to ensure that it is READING protocols, that is the only pathway for a fix I see at this point

policy_status:
	value: violated
	justification: "The display clearly violated university policies against discrimination and harassment. According to PHIL-001, while UCLA is bound by First Amendment protections, they state: 'Words can devastate—offline and on, even when the speaker doesn't intend to do so. This reality explains why free speech doctrine has categorical exceptions.' Given the explicit antisemitic nature of the display as detailed by Professor Myers in DB-001, who explains it incorporates historical antisemitic tropes, and UCLA's own characterization in ADM-001 as 'hateful and racist depictions' that are 'a complete affront to UCLA's Principles of Community and True Bruin Values,' this display crossed the line from protected speech to harassment and discrimination."
	sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, PHIL-001]

GPT's hallucinated Block statement caused it to make up the statement date

latency_days:
  value: 1
  justification: "Incident occurred on March 19, 2024, and the Chancellor responded on 
  March 20, 2024 [ADM-001]."
  sources: [ADM-001, DB-001]

For target_tone I favor accusatory. This might be one case where the ai's can convince me to their side. Still need some tweaking though, their responses need to stay on-incident. 

GPT 

target_tone:
	value: fear/distress
	justification: "Found approximately 6 references to fear/distress: [DB-001] describes students 
	feeling ‘intimidated’ and ‘targeted’; [SOC-003], [SOC-004], [SOC-006-2], [SOC-007], and [SOC-008] 
	express emotional distress and fear of rising antisemitism. No other tone surpassed 60%."
	sources: [DB-001, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-006-2, SOC-007, SOC-008]

Claude 

target_tone:
	value: fear/distress
	justification: "Jewish community members expressed clear feelings of fear and being targeted. Image 4 shows a Jewish student stating 'This is why I'm scared of going to campus as an Israeli Jew.' MED-001 quotes UCLA Hillel Executive Director Dan Gold saying 'Jewish students were very disturbed, upset and concerned about the pig display.' DB-001 cites a 2024 report showing '56% of Jewish university students polled after Oct. 7 felt in personal danger.' Another comment in Image 7 states 'as a Jew that was really disheartening to see my fellow students defending that shit.' These statements consistently express emotional vulnerability and fear."
	sources: [DB-001, MED-001, Image 4, Image 7]

5/13/2025 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GPT: 

media_coverage_level:
  value: network-amplified
  justification: "Seven distinct social media posts (SOC-001 through SOC-008 excluding 
    SOC-005) show intra-network amplification across Jewish, pro-Israel, and anti-discrimination 
    channels. No general public media sources cited."
  sources:
    - SOC-001
    - SOC-002
    - SOC-003
    - SOC-004
    - SOC-006-2
    - SOC-007
    - SOC-008

norm_violation_type:
  value: bias/discrimination
  justification: "\"This display of Jew-hatred... speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli 
    students are experiencing\" [MED-001] and [DB-001] describes the symbolic content as 
    evoking antisemitic tropes. This meets the threshold for norm-level bias/discrimination."
  sources:
    - MED-001
    - DB-001

This quote above is not an exact quote. “The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day." If it pulls quotes they must be exact. 

latency_days:
  value: 7
  justification: "Incident occurred March 20–21, 2024; Chancellor's statement 
    published March 28, 2024 [ADM-001]."
  sources:
    - ADM-001

(It may be in best interest to OCR any image files and label them)

media_positioning:
  value: group_targeting
  justification: "\"They seem to be calling the UC Regents Zionist pigs... I get it now\" 
    [SOC-004] and \"pig person holding money bags next to Jewish star = pure antisemitism\" 
    [SOC-008] frame the effigy as targeting Jews or Zionist identity."
  sources:
    - SOC-004
    - SOC-008

 Above confusing student positioning with media

actor_tone:
  value: defiant
  justification: "Found 5+ references to defiant tone: [SOC-006-2] describes \"shutting 
    it down\", and [SOC-007] includes posts mocking those calling the display antisemitic. 
    Comments defend the protest and reject criticism. No other tone surpassed 60%."
  sources:
    - SOC-006-2
    - SOC-007

Above it is over-generalizing regarding who the "actors" are

target_tone:
  value: fear/distress
  justification: "Found 6+ references: [SOC-004] user says \"this is why I'm scared 
    to go to campus\"; [SOC-008] \"to deny that is disgusting\" shows emotional distress. 
    [MED-001] quotes Hillel reporting Jewish student concern."
  sources:
    - SOC-004
    - SOC-008
    - MED-001

Why doesn't it reference any other tone or whether it surpassed 60%?


target_positioning:
  value: rights-based
  justification: "\"Jewish students described the display as threatening and called on 
    the university to uphold inclusion and dignity\" [MED-001], reflecting civil rights 
    framing."
  sources:
    - MED-001

It may be the case that it arbitrarily put quotes around sentences preceeding a reference, it therefor thinks that it is directly quoting in some instances when it is not. I.e. this above "quote" in target_positioning does not exist. 

5/14/25 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Claude

org_affiliated_actor:
 value: true
 justification: |
  MED-001: "During the meeting, pro-Palestinian students spoke out during public comment, 
  where they urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that support the 'ongoing genocide and ethnic 
  cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times." MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community 
  from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the 
  genocide of Palestinians." Based on these quotes, it appears the protest, which included the pig 
  effigy display, was organized by students from UC campuses, indicating organizational affiliation.
 sources: [MED-001]

This proves they are students, it doesn't prove they're in a student org

actor_student:
 value: true
 justification: |
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried 
  out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians." 
  This quote explicitly states that students were involved in the protest where the pig effigy was displayed.
 sources: [MED-001]

It really doesn't need to do this, it should be default: student

admin_support_offered:
 value: positive_inclusion
 justification: |
  ADM-001: "It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well 
  as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity. We remain committed 
  to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus." 
  This statement explicitly affirms the dignity and rights of Jewish members of the community, which 
  meets the definition of positive_inclusion as described in the codebook.
 sources: [ADM-001]

This proves combination, not just positive inclusion. It is also general_commmitment

actor_group:
 value: Palestinian
 justification: |
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried 
  out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians." 
  MED-001: "A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that support the 
  'ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times." These quotes identify 
  the actors as pro-Palestinian protesters.
 sources: [MED-001]

 It needs to either use the logic in org_affiliated_actor or it needs to find evidence directly linking the incident to the actors. It is inferring here when better information is available. 

media_coverage_level:
 value: network-amplified
 justification: |
  Following the media_coverage_level protocol: I have identified exactly 5 qualifying sources: 
  MED-001 (Jewish Journal coverage), plus sources documented in MED-001 including Israel War Room X account post, 
  ADL Los Angeles statement, UCLA Hillel Executive Director statement, and LA Times coverage. 
  
  While these sources represent significant coverage, they remain primarily within Jewish and/or academic 
  news ecosystems, without clear evidence of broad mainstream pickup beyond these networks. The sources 
  referenced do not specifically indicate that this incident reached the viewership threshold (≥100k views) 
  required for 'high' classification. 
  
  This meets the criteria for 'network-amplified' because there are at least 5 sources within a single 
  ecosystem, without clear evidence of mainstream pickup beyond these communities.
 sources: [MED-001]

This is actually very good, but it needs to not look for sources within sources and include them in the primary selection. It can comment on sources within sources, if that might be helpful as additional commentary. 

severity_score:
 value: low
 justification: |
  Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows absence of direct physical harm, 
  absence of credible risk to physical safety, absence of disruption to campus operations, and absence of 
  escalation that affected individuals, operations, or safety.

  ADM-001: "The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed." 
  
  MED-001: "During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down through various actions such as propping up Tent City, 
  students camping out near Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents and 
  showcasing a reminder of the disparate conditions many Palestinian refugees face due to ongoing genocide."
  
  This incident does not qualify for 'moderate' severity because there is no evidence of disruption requiring 
  a response from authorities, confrontations, or property damage. While the display was offensive, there is 
  no documentation in the sources of any measurable interference with university operations or institutional 
  safety. The incident is properly classified as 'low' severity because while the display caused offense, 
  there was no credible threat or physical harm documented, and any disturbance was brief and self-resolving 
  without requiring intervention.
 sources: [ADM-001, MED-001]


This quote doesn't appear in MED-001

actor_tone:
 value: defiant
 justification: |
  I reviewed the following sources containing actor tone indicators: MED-001.

  Found approximately 3 references to defiant tone (100%), 0 references to other tones (0%).

  Evidence for defiant tone:
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in 
  to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians."
  
  MED-001: "During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down through various actions such as propping up Tent City, 
  students camping out near Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents."

  I considered both frequency and intensity by examining the language used to describe the actors' behavior, 
  which suggests deliberate resistance and pushing boundaries by making their presence 'inescapable' and 
  displaying controversial imagery.

  Based on this quantitative analysis, defiant represents 100% of tone references, meeting the 60% threshold 
  for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding is defiant.
 sources: [MED-001]

Correct, but the wrong source label. This is SOC-006-2. 

target_tone:
 value: fear/distress
 justification: |
  I reviewed the following sources containing target tone indicators: DB-001, MED-001.

  Found approximately 6 references to fear/distress (67%), 3 references to accusatory (33%).

  Evidence for fear/distress:
  MED-001: "Jewish students 'were very disturbed, upset and concerned' about the pig display."
  
  MED-001: "Jewish students spoke out during public comment, where they denounced the 'growing harassment 
  against faculty and students who support Israel [...] swastikas painted on buildings and signs calling 
  Jews 'the new Nazis.'"

  Evidence for accusatory:
  DB-001: "To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not to recoil."
  
  DB-001: "Again, to anyone familiar with the repertoire of antisemitic images, it is hard to regard 
  the assemblage of the pig, bag of money and star of David as anything other than a case of antisemitism 
  that taps into deeply ingrained stereotypes."

  I considered both frequency and intensity by examining the emotional content of the responses, where 
  the targets' expressions of feeling "disturbed," "upset," and "concerned" convey direct emotional distress, 
  while the accusatory elements focus more on analysis of the imagery.

  Based on this quantitative analysis, fear/distress represents 67% of tone references, meeting the 60% 
  threshold for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding is fear/distress.
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

 I changed the tone requirements in protocols and I over-restricted it. Primary accounts of tone should always take precedence. The pig effigy doesn't have to be literally tied to every justification, I just don't want it commenting on contextual elements, which it did here anyways (second MED-001 reference).

 The obvious quote for this one was "this is why I'm afraid to come to campus." It probably didn't pick that one because I over-constrained it. 

"Accusatory elements are more on analysis of the imagery?" Doesn't really make sense either. Re-establish a working definition of accusatory. 

actor_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: |
  MED-001: "A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that 
  support the 'ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times." 
  
  MED-001: "During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in 
  to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians." 
  
  These quotes show the actors framing their protest around moral rights and freedoms for Palestinians, 
  positioning their actions as defending the rights of an oppressed group.
 sources: [MED-001]

 Again this is incorrect quoting from MED-001 (2nd quote)

target_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: |
  DB-001: "It is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right 
  to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land 
  they inhabit." 
  
  MED-001: "We ask the Regents to speak up and denounce this antisemitic display and make clear that 
  there is no tolerance for antisemitism on University campuses. Their silence on this issue is complicity." 
  
  These quotes indicate that the targets are framing the incident in terms of civil rights and fair treatment, 
  focusing on their right to exist without discrimination or antisemitism on campus.
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

 I want it to stay on-incident as much as possible, on-incident is priority, context is secondary. Also the students are the true targets and there are no student quotes. 

 5/22/25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The Claude version was updated sine the last run, to Claude 4? I don't know this run is Claude Opus 4)

Claude is really doing everything correctly, some of the rules are not tweaked quite right (media_coverage_level) or the files aren't prepared enough (alt text for images) 

incident_id: INC-001
date: 2024-03-20
source_ids: [ADM-001, DB-001, MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-005, SOC-006, SOC-007]
keywords: [pig effigy, antisemitism, uc regents, protest, divestment]

wrong. It is overwriting file names. Where did it get the keyword pig effigy? Should only take keywords from the sources? 

org_affiliated_actor:
value: false
justification: "After examining all sources, no student organization was explicitly identified as 
 responsible for creating or placing the pig effigy. MED-001: 'BDS activists camped out' indicates 
 general protest presence but does not establish organizational responsibility for the specific 
 effigy. DB-001: 'someone placed in the designated free speech area next to the regents' meeting 
 a statue' - uses 'someone' without organizational attribution. No source provides evidence of an 
 organization claiming responsibility, hosting, or publicly endorsing this specific display."
sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, MED-001]

wrong (ok). Write alt text for .png files.

admin_support_offered:
value: general_commitment
justification: "ADM-001: 'We remain committed to doing all we can to support the safety and 
 protect the rights of everyone on our campus.' This reaffirms existing commitments without 
 acknowledging specific institutional responsibility or need for change. The administration did 
 not offer counseling referrals, violation warnings, campus climate initiatives, positive 
 inclusion statements for specific groups, or acknowledgment of institutional gaps."
sources: [ADM-001]

wrong, technically "multiple" because "It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity." is positive_inclusion. 

media_coverage_level:
 value: low
 justification: "Following the media_coverage_level protocol: I identified 2 qualifying sources 
   within 14 days - MED-001 (Jewish Journal, March 22) and the social media posts (SOC-001 through 
   SOC-007 from March 21). The Jewish Journal represents an internal/niche ecosystem source serving 
   the Jewish community. The social media posts, while numerous, remained within specific 
   communities without mainstream pickup. No sources with general public reach (like LAist, KTLA, 
   LAT, NYT) were identified. This meets the threshold for 'low' (at least 2 internal or niche 
   sources, no external visibility)."
 sources: [MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-005, SOC-006, SOC-007]

 the logic in the codebook_with_coding_protocol was updated incorrectly - "If there is ambiguity about threshold requirements, DEFAULT to the lower level" is present while "Assign the HIGHEST qualifying level where ALL minimum thresholds are met:" was removed. Remedy this in the document. It has already been reverted in the codebook document. 

 policy_status:
 value: compliant
 justification: "After reviewing POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, and PHIL-001 in their entirety, I have 
   determined that this incident was compliant with policy. The administration did not explicitly 
   state a policy violation occurred. While ADM-001 condemned the display as 'appalling and hateful' 
   and 'a complete affront to UCLA's Principles of Community,' this represents moral condemnation 
   rather than a determination of policy violation. PHIL-001 establishes that 'hate speech is 
   protected speech' and that UCLA as a state actor must protect free expression even when offensive. 
   The display was placed in the 'designated free speech area' (DB-001) during a public protest. 
   While the imagery invoked antisemitic stereotypes, which PHIL-001 acknowledges can 'wound in 
   severe and concrete ways,' it does not rise to the categorical exceptions of unprotected speech 
   such as 'true threats' or harassment that 'substantially impairs a person's access to University 
   programs.' The display constituted offensive political expression protected by the First Amendment 
   at a public university."
 sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, PHIL-001, POL-001]

this is not entirely correct and it doesn't follow the format: 

# For policy_status specifically
policy_status:
  value: selected_value
  justification: "After reviewing POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, and PHIL-001 in their entirety, I have determined that this incident [value]
     POL-XXX: \"[Exact quote from relevant policy document]\"
     PHIL-001: \"[Exact quote about free speech protections and categorical exceptions]\"
     [If administrative statement exists]: ADM-XXX: \"[Exact quote showing administrative position]\"
     Weighing the [nature of speech/conduct] against UCLA's obligations as a state actor bound by the First Amendment, this incident [does/does not] rise to the level of unprotected speech because [specific analysis referencing categorical exceptions in PHIL-001]. [Explain why the speech does/doesn't meet specific unprotected categories]."
   sources: [POL-XXX, PHIL-001, other relevant sources]

Does it need this format? (the OUTPUT FORMAT section says, "exact structure," clearly it can't meet that obligation)

In the last quote, it needs to put the source in-text so the reader knows what the source is, "it does not rise to the categorical exceptions of unprotected speech such as 'true threats' or harassment that 'substantially impairs a person's access to University programs.'"

variable_name:
  value: selected_value
  justification: "SOURCE-001: \"Exact quote from source about THIS incident.\" SOURCE-002: \"Another relevant exact quote.\" Based on these quotes, the evidence indicates that [interpretation]."
  sources: [SOURCE-001, SOURCE-002, ...]

The issue may have something to do with this rule (above) overriding the variable-specific rule. 

severity_score:
 value: low
 justification: "Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows no observable direct 
   physical harm, no credible risk to physical safety, no disruption to campus operations, and no 
   disruption to institutional safety. DB-001 notes the display 'was deeply wounding to many 
   members of the campus community' but documents no physical harm or operational disruption. 
   ADM-001 confirms 'The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed' without 
   mentioning any security response, disruption, or escalation. While the display caused 
   psychological distress through offensive imagery, there is no evidence of measurable disruption 
   to campus operations or institutional safety response. The incident does not qualify for moderate 
   severity as there was no confrontation, threat, or required intervention documented."
 sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

Again, didn't follow the below exactly.

severity_score:
  value: [low/moderate/elevated/high]
  justification: "Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows [presence/absence of each element]. 
  
  SOURCE-XXX: \"[Exact quote documenting presence/absence of physical harm]\"
  SOURCE-XXX: \"[Exact quote documenting presence/absence of credible risk]\"
  SOURCE-XXX: \"[Exact quote documenting presence/absence of disruption]\"
  
  This incident does not qualify for [higher level] because [explicit explanation of why higher threshold not met]. The incident is properly classified as [selected level] because [specific criteria met]."
  sources: [SOURCE-XXX, SOURCE-XXX]

police_involvement:
 value: none
 justification: "No source mentions any police presence, monitoring, or involvement in response to 
   the pig effigy display. ADM-001 notes 'The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been 
   removed' without reference to police action."
 sources: [ADM-001, DB-001, MED-001]

Why does it reference three sources?

The codebook needs to be more explicit, then the codebook_with_coding_protocol can be improved. But not sure why it referenced three sources. It checked three? It should check all sources and only reference sources it uses to draw its conclusion.

latency_days:
 value: 8
 justification: "The incident occurred on March 20-21, 2024 (using March 20 as the start date). 
   ADM-001 is dated March 28, 2024. The number of days between March 20 and March 28 is 8 days."
 sources: [ADM-001]

It should state where it gets the date from.

actor_tone:
 value: combination
 justification: "I reviewed the following sources containing actor tone indicators: [SOC-003, 
   SOC-005]. Found approximately 1 reference to defensive tone (50%), 1 reference to defiant tone 
   (50%). Evidence for defensive: SOC-003 shows a commenter defending the display: 'Jews advocating 
   for peace do not seem to share this fear though, they are rejecting Zionism fiercely too and 
   dissociate from genociders.' Evidence for defiant: SOC-005: 'Although our sit-in was originally 
   set to be in the Luskin Conference Center hotel lobby, peaceful protestors were' - shows defiant 
   framing of their actions. No single tone reaches the 60% threshold, so coding as combination of 
   defensive and defiant."
 sources: [SOC-003, SOC-005]

 start with the above, this is likely issues with the coding instructions. Also, there is no SOC-005 it's been given. The photos need to be alt texted. It took a comment on the SOC-003 photo out of context. Use powerpoint just edit the photos with OCR text or instructions. 

 target_tone:
 value: fear/distress
 justification: "I reviewed the following sources containing target tone indicators: [MED-001, 
   SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-004, DB-001]. Found approximately 5 references to fear/distress (100%), 
   0 references to other tones. Evidence for fear/distress: MED-001: 'Jewish students were very 
   disturbed, upset and concerned about the pig display.' SOC-004: 'At UCLA today. This is why I'm 
   scared of going to campus as an Israeli Jew.' DB-001: 'the statue was deeply wounding to many 
   members of the campus community.' SOC-001 caption: 'UCLA: A figure depicting Jews as pigs 
   suggesting Jews prioritize money over lives.' SOC-002: 'Students and faculty across California 
   are impacted by this hateful bigotry.' Fear/distress represents 100% of tone references, 
   meeting the 60% threshold for predominant tone."

 wrong. this is skewed. 

 admin_response_level:
 value: minimal
 justification: "Derived variable based on: admin_response_type = incident_specific, 
   accountability_follow_up = none, admin_support_offered = general_commitment. According to the 
   derivation matrix, when there is an incident-specific response but both accountability_follow_up 
   and admin_support_offered show no meaningful action (general_commitment being essentially 
   'none'), this represents a purely symbolic gesture and should be coded as minimal."
 sources: [ADM-001]

 admin_response_level should consider the lag in response of the administration as well. Either way this answer is incorrect. 

 chatGPT not logged, it was mostly incorrect (see below, didn't bother obtaining the remaining output)

incident_id: INC-001
date: '2024-03-20'
source_ids: [DB-001, ADM-001, MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-006-2, SOC-007, SOC-008]
keywords: [effigy, regents, antisemitism, keffiyeh, symbolic protest]

org_affiliated_actor:
  value: false
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001: "The effigy was not attributed to any specific student group in Daily Bruin coverage." SOURCE ADM-001: "The administrative statement makes no mention of an involved organization." Based on these quotes, there is no explicit evidence that any UCLA student organization claimed, hosted, or was identified as sponsoring this display. Per codebook rule, absence of explicit org affiliation requires coding this variable as false.'
  sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

actor_student:
  value: true
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001: "Hundreds of students gathered outside the UC Regents meeting." No source states or implies that the individuals who constructed or placed the pig effigy were non-students. Per codebook protocol, actor_student is coded true unless there is an explicit assertion of non-student status. No such assertion exists here.'
  sources: [DB-001]

admin_response_type:
  value: incident_specific
  justification: 'SOURCE ADM-001: "The antisemitic image displayed near the March Regents meeting has no place on our campus." This explicitly references the pig effigy incident and was issued within 2 weeks of the event. Per codebook rules, this meets the criteria for incident_specific.'
  sources: [ADM-001]

accountability_follow_up:
  value: none
  justification: 'SOURCE ADM-001: The statement condemns the incident but contains no mention of investigation, referral, or intent to pursue disciplinary or accountability processes. Per protocol, absence of such a statement qualifies as none.'
  sources: [ADM-001]

admin_support_offered:
  value: positive_inclusion
  justification: 'SOURCE ADM-001: "We will work to ensure that those who advocate on behalf of Palestinians can also be confident of their physical safety on our campuses." This affirms the dignity and rights of the named, targeted group. Per codebook, this constitutes positive_inclusion.'
  sources: [ADM-001]

target_group:
  value: Jewish
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001: "Jewish students said the pig effigy... evoked antisemitic stereotypes." SOURCE ADM-001: "The antisemitic image displayed... has no place on our campus." This confirms the incident was perceived as targeting Jewish identity. Thus, Jewish is the appropriate classification per the codebook.'
  sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

actor_group:
  value: Palestinian
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001: "The statue stood next to divestment signs and other Palestinian solidarity symbols, including a keffiyeh." This associates the actor with pro-Palestinian symbolism and goals. Thus, Palestinian is the appropriate actor identity label for this incident.'
  sources: [DB-001]

media_coverage_level:
  value: network-amplified
  justification: "Following the media_coverage_level protocol:\nSOURCE MED-001: \"Tablet Magazine published an article highlighting the antisemitic elements of the pig effigy display.\"\nSOURCE SOC-001 to SOC-004, SOC-006-2, SOC-007, SOC-008: Visuals and social media commentary by Jewish students and community members responding to the display.\nI have identified exactly 8 qualifying sources: [MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-006-2, SOC-007, SOC-008].\nOf these, MED-001 (Tablet) has general public reach based on its role as a national publication with wide readership.\nThis meets the criteria for 'network-amplified' because ≥6 sources appear within a single ecosystem (Jewish-affiliated response networks), but no major cross-ecosystem mainstream coverage was documented."
  sources: [MED-001, SOC-001, SOC-002, SOC-003, SOC-004, SOC-006-2, SOC-007, SOC-008]

location:
  value: on-campus
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001: "The protest occurred outside the UC Regents meeting at UCLA." This places the incident within UCLA campus grounds, qualifying as on-campus per protocol.'
  sources: [DB-001]

policy_status:
  value: compliant
  justification: "After reviewing POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, and PHIL-001 in their entirety, I have determined that this incident is compliant.\nPOL-003: The UC Anti-Discrimination Policy prohibits harassment that is severe, persistent, and targeted. There is no evidence that the effigy display was directed at individuals or repeated.\nPHIL-001: \"Offensive, antisemitic, or racist content is generally protected unless it constitutes a true threat or harassment that substantially interferes with educational access.\"\nADM-001: \"The antisemitic image displayed… has no place on our campus\"—this is condemnation, but it does not declare a formal violation.\nWeighing the offensive nature of the effigy against UCLA's obligations as a state actor bound by the First Amendment, the display is protected symbolic speech and does not rise to the level of unprotected categories. Therefore, the incident is properly coded as 'compliant'."
  sources: [POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, PHIL-001, ADM-001]

policy_violation_type:
  value: none
  justification: "Because 'policy_status' is coded as 'compliant', there is no policy violation to classify. Per protocol, this variable must be 'none' when policy compliance is determined."
  sources: []

norm_violation_type:
  value: bias/discrimination
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001: "Jewish students said the pig effigy... evoked antisemitic stereotypes." SOURCE ADM-001: "The antisemitic image displayed... has no place on our campus." These quotes demonstrate that the incident was perceived as identity-based harm against a protected group. This meets the criteria for a norm violation under bias/discrimination.'
  sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

severity_score:
  value: low
  justification: 'Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows no evidence of physical harm, credible threats, or measurable disruption:\n\nSOURCE DB-001: "The protest was peaceful and remained outside the Regents meeting."\nSOURCE ADM-001: The statement addresses emotional harm but does not reference risk, injury, or operational impact.\n\nThis incident does not qualify for moderate severity because no confrontation, enforcement, or disruption occurred. It is properly classified as low severity based on absence of observable escalation or harm.'
  sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

police_involvement:
  value: none
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001 and ADM-001: Neither mention any police presence, monitoring, or action in response to this protest display. Per protocol, this qualifies as none.'
  sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

latency_days:
  value: 2
  justification: 'SOURCE DB-001: Identifies the incident occurring on March 20, 2024.\nSOURCE ADM-001: The administrative response was issued March 22, 2024.\nPer protocol, latency_days = 2 days between incident and admin response.'

GPT o3

Did a much better job, although the output is out of order 

admin_support_offered:
  value: multiple
  justification: |
    • SOURCE ADM-001: “It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community … are treated with respect and dignity.” → *positive_inclusion*  
    • SOURCE ADM-001: “We remain committed to doing all we can to **support the safety and protect the rights** of everyone on our campus.” → *general_commitment*  
    • SOURCE MED-001: “UC campuses will be partnering with the **Hillel Campus Initiative** … to better address campus antisemitism.” → *campus_climate_initiative*  
    Presence of ≥ 2 support types ⇒ `multiple`.

The codebook was updated with the below copied to this variable as well. Not sure how much I should over-constrain it. Tell it to only read adm statements for this one. 

Concurrent statements that may incidentally relate, but are not “responses” are not considered (i.e. a UC-wide campus climate initiative announced at an event where an incident takes place at UCLA is not considered a response).

media_coverage_level:
  value: moderate
  justification: |
    Following the media-coverage protocol:  
    1. SOC-001 (Israel War Room tweet) – general-public reach (10 k+ views).  
    2. SOC-002 (ADL California tweet) – general-public reach (40 k+ views).  
    3. MED-001 (Jewish Journal article) – general-public outlet.  
    4. SOC-003 (SJP UCLA Instagram story) – ecosystem-specific.  
    5. SOC-004 (Reddit r/Jewish post, 1.6 k up-votes) – ecosystem-specific.  
    6–7. SOC-007 & SOC-008 (Reddit comment threads) – same ecosystem.  
    → 7 qualifying sources across multiple ecosystems, with ≥ 2 general-public outlets ⇒ `moderate`.

wrong. doesn't understand general public reach. 


actor_tone:
  value: combination
  justification: |
    **Tone reference count** (total = 3):  
    – *mobilizing/escalatory* (2): SOC-006-2 (“carried out a 3-day sit-in … making our presence inescapable”); SOC-003 overlay encourages continued activism.  
    – *defiant* (1): SOC-003 comment: “I hate Zionists but have no issues with Jews.”  
    No tone ≥ 60 %; therefore `combination` (mobilizing/escalatory + defiant).

need to force a minimum total source count. at least 5. 

target_tone:
  value: accusatory
  justification: |
    **Tone reference count** (total = 6):  
    – *accusatory* (4): SOC-002 (“Their silence on this issue is **complicity**”); SOC-001 tweet; multiple Reddit comments calling display “blatant antisemitism.”  
    – *fear/distress* (2): SOC-004 (“This is why **I’m scared** of going to campus as an Israeli Jew.”); Reddit user cool_username_: “really **disheartening** to see my fellow students defending that.”  
    4 / 6 = 67 % accusatory ≥ 60 % ⇒ predominant tone = `accusatory`.

I want every example it uses to make the calculation spelled out. 

policy_status:
  value: compliant
  justification: |
    SOURCE DB-001: “placed in the **designated free-speech area** next to the regents’ meeting.”  
    No policy breach alleged by administration → `compliant`.

ran o3 twice (the out of order made me think it didn't finish analysis). the first run was better than this, wrt this response. it referenced policy and a policy doc. in this case it did not, at all. 

latency_days:
  value: 2
  justification: |
    SOURCE DB-001 sets earliest incident date as **Mar 20 2024** (statue appeared “March 20-21”).  
    SOURCE MED-001 records earliest admin response in the *Jewish Journal* on **Friday Mar 22 2024** (“In a Friday statement … the university said”).  
    22 Mar – 20 Mar = **2 days**.

Pretty bad that it didn't know to look at the adm statement. It's specified to look at adm in the codebook_with_coding_protocol document.
