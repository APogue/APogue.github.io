- Some universities have explored incident-responsive restorative dialogue as a way to address harm and rebuild trust between student communities after tense or discriminatory events. Do you think that’s something you or your peers at Hillel would be open to participating in—when appropriate—or is there more comfort in addressing incidents within your own community or through parallel processes—like holding your own community discussions, working directly with administrators, or issuing statements separately—without engaging directly with groups on the other side of the conflict?

    Do you see potential value in cross-community conversations after major campus incidents, or is the priority right now more about internal safety and healing?

- [3rd party IG post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4yVx9crpDa/), knowing this was endorsed by SJP and UCLA Divest, did incidents like this cause fear among Jewish students (this feels like a leading question, based on my hypothesis)

- Was the petition to have Verdugo impeached acknowledged by anyone on campus

- Have USAC members ignored calls for diplomacy with Hillel?

    - Has she or any other Jewish members of UCLA filed a Judicial Board petition before? Specifically referring to the [UCLA BIPAC message](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3a68r6uAHC/?igsh=ZWMyNDBlOTQyNg%3D%3D&img_index=3)

    - There was a recall petition, but did they go through any of the appropriate channels? 

    - She mentioned "the university doing nothing," had they submitted reports about CAC to the university before?

    “I have every reason to believe, based on these numbers – as well as the quotes we have from Verdugo – that our perceived associations with Zionism were attached to our Jewish faith, and we were rejected,” Brannon said.

    "In the memorandum granting the petition, Venkatesh said the board will formally consider whether Verdugo violated Article I, Section E of the USA Bylaws, which prevents USAC from supporting or being affiliated with “any organization which legally discriminates on the basis of: race, creed, sex (except as exempt from Title IX), age, national origin, religion, physical handicap, or sexual orientation.”"
