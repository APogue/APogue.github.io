Crime rates in New York have declined since the 1990s. Texas and California also show long-term downward trends in violent crime. Mississippi shows consistently lower rates but no meaningful downward trend[^1][^note].

Murder rate data are a subset of violent crime. Murder is a specific type of homicide: intentional, unlawful killing with malice aforethought (legal definition varies by state). The murder rate plot shows the same trends, with the exception of Mississippi, showing a downward trend but consistently higher murder rates than the other states[^note].
