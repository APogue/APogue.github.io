### Policy is Difficult

Policy requires rigor. A researcher must account for when data is multi-factorial and has covariates: more gun laws in CA correlate with a decrease in gun ownership over time, but are they a cause? How many things contributed to decreased gun ownership in CA and in what ways? The answer may be complex. 

A researcher also has to control for differing circumstances before data can be compared. Crimes recorded by police in Mississippi, for example, may not reflect the number of actual crimes that occurred due to victim underreporting in rural areas. A researcher would control for this in a comparative study. 

The issue is, processing data so that trends are precisely accurate and well understood can take ample time. What if we don't have that kind of time? Can we eliminate some common assumptions by looking raw data? Yes. As long as we aren't trying to figure out what caused the trends and we assume confidence error bounds in our comparisons (e.g. underreporting is not so significant in MS that it would change its violent crime rank compared to other states). Let's try. 

### Incident Rates in New York, Texas, California, and Mississippi

Crime rates in New York have declined since the 1990s. Texas and California also show long-term downward trends in violent crime. Mississippi shows consistently lower rates but no meaningful downward trend.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^note]

Murder rate data are a subset of violent crime. Murder is a specific type of homicide: intentional, unlawful killing with malice aforethought (legal definition varies by state). The murder rate plot shows the same trends, with the exception of Mississippi showing a downward trend but consistently higher murder rates.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

According to the CDC, firearm-related deaths include unintentional discharges (W32–W34), suicides (X72–X74), homicides (X93–X95), deaths of undetermined intent (Y22–Y24), legal intervention (Y35.0), and terrorism involving firearms (rare, U01.4).[^6][^9]
