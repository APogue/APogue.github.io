### Usefulness of UCR Data
"UCR crime statistics are used in many ways and serve many purposes. They provide law
enforcement with data for use in budget formulation, planning, resource allocation, assessment
of police operations, etc., to help address the crime problem at various levels. Chambers of
commerce and tourism agencies examine these data to see how they impact the particular
geographic jurisdictions they represent. Criminal justice researchers study the nature, cause,
and movement of crime over time. Legislators draft anti-­‐crime measures using the research
findings and recommendations of law enforcement administrators, planners, as well as public
and private entities concerned with crime problems. The news media use the crime statistics
provided by the UCR Program to inform the public about the state of crime as it compares to
the national level."

### NIBRS

"As recommended by professional law enforcement organizations, the FBI has made nationwide implementation of NIBRS a top priority because NIBRS can provide more useful statistics to promote constructive discussion, measured planning, and informed policing. To increase participation, the UCR Program is partnering with the Bureau of Justice Statistics on the National Crime Statistics Exchange, working with advocacy groups to emphasize the importance of NIBRS data, and transitioned the UCR Program to a NIBRS-only data collection, as of Jan. 1, 2021. In addition, the UCR Program has made resources available to help agencies address the cost of transitioning, as well as the potential perception that an agency has higher crime levels when NIBRS actually establishes a new baseline that more precisely captures reported crime in a community."

"By recommendation of the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Advisory Policy Board and with the support of the nation's major law enforcement organizations, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program retired its long-time Summary Reporting System (SRS) and began accepting crime data exclusively via the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)–a much more comprehensive data collection system–on January 1, 2021. Incident-based data allow us to visualize details regarding individual offenses and arrests that were part of an incident, such as information about the victim, offender, property involved, and arrestees, providing context that is not provided by the summary data.

For the 2022 data year, to provide nationally representative data, the FBI accepted Summary Reporting System data submissions from non-transitioned agencies. This interim measure will ensure more complete data as agencies continue to transition to NIBRS."

### Total Incident Counts in California, Mississippi, New York, and Texas

"The FBI’s UCR Program defines murder and nonnegligent manslaughter as the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another. The classification of this offense is based solely on police investigation as opposed to the determination of a court, medical examiner, coroner, jury, or other judicial body. The UCR Program does not include the following situations in this offense classification: deaths caused by negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable homicides; and attempts to murder or assaults to murder, which are classified as aggravated assaults."[^10] "The UCR Program includes data from more than 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies. Agencies participate voluntarily and submit their crime data either through a state UCR program or directly to the FBI's UCR Program."[^9]

According to the CDC, assault-by-firearm deaths include assault by handgun discharge (X93), assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge (X94) and assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge (X95). The CDC classifies any assault resulting in death using several more ICD-10 codes (X85-Y09).[^6]   Every violent-injury or assault-related death in the CDC WONDER database originates from a coroner/ME determination and is reported via the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This reporting is universal and mandatory. (Coroners/medical examiners (C/ME) are the legal authority for certifying cause and manner of death, but they often draw on law enforcement information as part of that determination.)

There is a distinction between the UCR's "homicide" and CDC's "assault" definitions. UCR's homicide definition excludes justifiable homicides (legal intervention and self-defense). CDC defines assault as injuries intentionally inflicted by another person with intent to harm or kill. This includes self-defense killings but excludes legal intervention. The CDC codes for homicide expand the definition even further beyond the UCR definition (terrorism-related and sequelae of assault).[^13]

"The ICD-9 was used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates until 1999, when use of ICD-10 for mortality coding started."[^11]

"Likely related to several of the aforementioned factors, considerable variability exists across both states and countries in terms of the frequency and rates of deaths of undetermined intent.10,19 In many states, the undetermined category is used infrequently. In others, it represents a large proportion of violent deaths."[^12]

The change from IDC-9 to IDC-10 codes in 1999 saw the "undetermined" cause of death category expanded and split by mechanism. It is possible (but not studied here) that adaptations to changes in the IDC coding system in the early 2000's lead to more conservative categorization in coding edge cases, i.e. the IDC code change may have lead to more deaths ruled as "undetermined" for a period of time. This may explain the lower CDC assault counts compared to UCR as a factor separate from any baseline variations between police investigations and medical opinions.

Aside from these outlier patterns, based on the agency information given (UCR participation is voluntary, excludes justifiable homicides, etc.) we expect the UCR data to fall between the CDC total assault and assault-by-firearm data. In Mississippi it does not.

### Comparing UCR Gaps in California, Mississippi, New York, and Texas

Judging from Mississippi alone, the UCR data is unusable.

### UCR Data From 2021 - 2025

They switched to another system. They failed to collect enough data in 2021. In 2022 they allowed data submission through the previous collection system to try stabilize data quality. CDC WONDER data is unpublished for this time period. Provisional data beyond 2020 is available through NVSS but inclusion in the WONDER dataset incurs significant processing lag. 

"Provisional data are based on death certificate data received, but not yet fully reviewed, by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Provisional data provide an early estimate of deaths before the release of final data."[^14]

Population denominators are the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1 resident state population estimates (Vintage 2019: 2018–2019; Vintage 2024: 2020–2024). These totals are appropriate for crude rate calculations and are compatible with CDC death counts.
