### Total Incident Counts in California, Mississippi, New York, and Texas

"The FBI’s UCR Program defines murder and nonnegligent manslaughter as the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another. The classification of this offense is based solely on police investigation as opposed to the determination of a court, medical examiner, coroner, jury, or other judicial body. The UCR Program does not include the following situations in this offense classification: deaths caused by negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable homicides; and attempts to murder or assaults to murder, which are classified as aggravated assaults."[^10] "The UCR Program includes data from more than 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies. Agencies participate voluntarily and submit their crime data either through a state UCR program or directly to the FBI's UCR Program."[^9]

According to the CDC, assault-by-firearm deaths include assault by handgun discharge (X93), assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge (X94) and assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge (X95). The CDC classifies any assault resulting in death using several more ICD-10 codes (X85-Y09).[^6] Every violent-injury or assault-related death in the CDC WONDER database originates from a coroner/ME determination and is reported via the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This reporting is universal and mandatory. 

There is a distinction between the UCR's "homicide" and CDC's "assault" definitions. UCR's homicide definition excludes justifiable homicides (legal intervention and self-defense). CDC defines assault as injuries intentionally inflicted by another person with intent to harm or kill. This includes self-defense killings but excludes legal intervention. 

"The ICD-9 was used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates until 1999, when use of ICD-10 for mortality coding started."[^11]

"Likely related to several of the aforementioned factors, considerable variability exists across both states and countries in terms of the frequency and rates of deaths of undetermined intent.10,19 In many states, the undetermined category is used infrequently. In others, it represents a large proportion of violent deaths."[^12]

The change from IDC-9 to IDC-10 codes in 1999 saw the "undetermined" cause of death category expanded and split by mechanism. It is possible (but not studied here) that adaptations to changes in the IDC coding system in the early 2000's lead to more conservative categorization in coding edge cases, i.e. the IDC code change may have lead to more deaths ruled as "undetermined" for a period of time. This may explain the lower CDC assault counts compared to UCR as a separate factor from any baseline variations between police investigations and medical opinions.

According to the CDC, firearm-related deaths include unintentional discharges (W32–W34), suicides (X72–X74), homicides (X93–X95), deaths of undetermined intent (Y22–Y24), legal intervention (Y35.0), and terrorism involving firearms (rare, U01.4).[^6][^9]


### Rand's Estimate of State-Level Household Firearm Ownership

The HFR line is RAND’s estimate of the proportion of adults living in a household with a firearm in a given state and year. The data is modeled from surveys and proxy records (firearm suicides, hunting licenses, Guns & Ammo subscriptions, background checks) rather than direct records as in previous plots.[^5]  

{% include figure image_path="/images/blog_images/ca-guns.png" alt="California gun chart" caption="California: Gun ownership trends" width="70%" %}

Household firearm ownership in CA fell from about 35% in 1980 to 15% in 2016, a decline of roughly 57%.

{% include figure image_path="/images/blog_images/ms-guns.png" alt="Mississippi gun chart" caption="Mississippi: Gun ownership trends" width="70%" %}

Household firearm ownership in MS fell from about 59% in 1980 to 53% in 2016, a decline of roughly 10.2%.

{% include figure image_path="/images/blog_images/ny-guns.png" alt="New York gun chart" caption="New York: Gun ownership trends" width="70%" %}

Household firearm ownership in NY fell from about 20% in 1980 to 13% in 2016, a decline of roughly 35%.

{% include figure image_path="/images/blog_images/texas-guns.png" alt="Texas gun chart" caption="Texas: Gun ownership trends" width="70%" %}

Household firearm ownership in TX fell from about 58% in 1980 to 34% in 2016, a decline of roughly 41%.
