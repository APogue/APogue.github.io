### Mississippi JAG Calculation (Formula; FY2024, PR excluded)

We use FBI CIUS **violent crime** as the crime proxy and 2023 mid-year population.

## Setup

Let the years be
$$
Y=\{2018,2019,2020\},\quad |Y|=3,
$$
and the universe of states (50 + DC, excluding minimum-only states and PR) be \(U\).

Per-year violent-crime totals:
$$
V_{U,y}=\sum_{j\in U} V_{j,y}.
$$

Universe violent-crime denominator (average of sums):
$$
\bar V_U=\frac{1}{|Y|}\sum_{y\in Y} V_{U,y}.
$$

State numerator (multi-year average):
$$
\bar V_{j}=\frac{1}{|Y|}\sum_{y\in Y} V_{j,y}.
$$

Population (2023 mid-year):
$$
P_U=\sum_{j\in U} P_j^{(2023)},\qquad \beta_j=\frac{P_j^{(2023)}}{P_U}.
$$

**Constants (FY2024, PR excluded):**
$$
R' = 231{,}481{,}934,\quad
C = P = 115{,}740{,}967,\quad
m = 675{,}636.
$$

**Puerto Rico removal already applied:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{PR Formula Portion} = 2{,}288{,}288 - 675{,}636 = 1{,}612{,}652 \\
&R' = 233{,}094{,}586 - 1{,}612{,}652 = 231{,}481{,}934
\end{aligned}
$$

## Shares

Violent-crime share (average of universe totals in the denominator):
$$
\alpha_j=\frac{\bar V_j}{\bar V_U}
=\frac{\tfrac{1}{|Y|}\sum_{y\in Y} V_{j,y}}{\tfrac{1}{|Y|}\sum_{y\in Y} V_{U,y}}
=\frac{\sum_{y\in Y} V_{j,y}}{\sum_{y\in Y} V_{U,y}}.
$$

Population share:
$$
\beta_j=\frac{P_j^{(2023)}}{P_U}.
$$


## Formula allocation

50/50 pools:
$$
F_j=\alpha_j\cdot C \;+\; \beta_j\cdot P.
$$

Add the statutory minimum:
$$
A_j=m+F_j.
$$

Minimum-only states $$i\in\{\text{ND},\text{VT},\text{WY}\}$$:
$$
A_i=m.
$$

### Notes
- Bridge funding is needed to transition to NIBRS
- Undercounting Mississippi’s lethal violence by 100% or more
- Compounding disadvantage: MS was undercounted even before NIBRS
- Relative to population, other states don't suffer the same proportional undercount
- MS reporting "improves" after NIBRS switch but doesn't translate into more accuracy. The switch exposes how weak the homicide reporting always was.
- Did FBI imputation methods change resulting in lower compensation? Doesn't seem that way by the NIBRS raw UCR data. It seems like reporting isn't happening. And yet MS's reporting coverage went up from prior years.
- Was the oboarding to NIBRS largely administrative in some states? Common sense questions whether moving to a more complex system requiring more IT and reporting expertise is likely to result in *higher* reporting coverage for a state that has continuously underreported in the past. 
- JAG's reliance on CIUS is systematically unfair for MS, the money is awarded based on a *voluntary* reporting basis which already doesn't make sense, but to then burden the reporting with more sophisticated systems while simultaneously underfunding them is even more confusing
- And the funding structure makes no sense. If you don't meet the minumum in terms of crime and population you get a floor amount. Everyone else gets the floor plus a formulaic amount. So handing the floor to everyone amounts to 37 million dollars. Only the states that don't meet the floor should get it. The rest of the 37 millon should go to states like MS. 
-	A universal floor acts like a windfall for well‐resourced states, while starving states like MS of the supplemental formula share they need most.
- Congress mandated NIBRS, but then didn’t design funding incentives to help the weakest systems upgrade.
- What it could be allocated to is high violence, low reporting states (while FBI data dampens the scale, lethal violence is still high relative to population, and reporting is very low). The FBI can't accurately know how much to fund. Creat an approach that pads the funding (a corrective factor) if the state agrees to transfer systems and improve reporting. A reporting transition pad. A supplimental adjustment pool funded out of or on top of the 37M floor. 
- Really because if we don't have data for what is going on nationwide, then we can't solve the crime or gun problems in the first place. You can't solve a problem if you don't know what it is. 
- JAG should be not just a formula + floor, but also a lever for national data integrity 
- Design a supplemental allocation that accounts for blind spots in FBI reporting and helps under-resourced states get to full NIBRS compliance.
- With JAG more money = more reporting, but it can't act *incentivise* to report if allocated money is merely supporting existing systems, this is even clearer with the switch and the downturn in data 
- Condition that supplemental money on reporting improvements. States don’t get it automatically — they’d have to commit to improving coverage, data timeliness, and system transfer.

### Usefulness of UCR Data
"UCR crime statistics are used in many ways and serve many purposes. They provide law
enforcement with data for use in budget formulation, planning, resource allocation, assessment
of police operations, etc., to help address the crime problem at various levels. Chambers of
commerce and tourism agencies examine these data to see how they impact the particular
geographic jurisdictions they represent. Criminal justice researchers study the nature, cause,
and movement of crime over time. Legislators draft anti-­‐crime measures using the research
findings and recommendations of law enforcement administrators, planners, as well as public
and private entities concerned with crime problems. The news media use the crime statistics
provided by the UCR Program to inform the public about the state of crime as it compares to
the national level."

### NIBRS
https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/nibrs

"As recommended by professional law enforcement organizations, the FBI has made nationwide implementation of NIBRS a top priority because NIBRS can provide more useful statistics to promote constructive discussion, measured planning, and informed policing. To increase participation, the UCR Program is partnering with the Bureau of Justice Statistics on the National Crime Statistics Exchange, working with advocacy groups to emphasize the importance of NIBRS data, and transitioned the UCR Program to a NIBRS-only data collection, as of Jan. 1, 2021. In addition, the UCR Program has made resources available to help agencies address the cost of transitioning, as well as the potential perception that an agency has higher crime levels when NIBRS actually establishes a new baseline that more precisely captures reported crime in a community."

"By recommendation of the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Advisory Policy Board and with the support of the nation's major law enforcement organizations, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program retired its long-time Summary Reporting System (SRS) and began accepting crime data exclusively via the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)–a much more comprehensive data collection system–on January 1, 2021. Incident-based data allow us to visualize details regarding individual offenses and arrests that were part of an incident, such as information about the victim, offender, property involved, and arrestees, providing context that is not provided by the summary data.

For the 2022 data year, to provide nationally representative data, the FBI accepted Summary Reporting System data submissions from non-transitioned agencies. This interim measure will ensure more complete data as agencies continue to transition to NIBRS."

### Total Incident Counts in California, Mississippi, New York, and Texas (UCR Raw Reporting)

"The FBI’s UCR Program defines murder and nonnegligent manslaughter as the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another. The classification of this offense is based solely on police investigation as opposed to the determination of a court, medical examiner, coroner, jury, or other judicial body. The UCR Program does not include the following situations in this offense classification: deaths caused by negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable homicides; and attempts to murder or assaults to murder, which are classified as aggravated assaults."[^10] "The UCR Program includes data from more than 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies. Agencies participate voluntarily and submit their crime data either through a state UCR program or directly to the FBI's UCR Program."[^9]

According to the CDC, assault-by-firearm deaths include assault by handgun discharge (X93), assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge (X94) and assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge (X95). The CDC classifies any assault resulting in death using several more ICD-10 codes (X85-Y09).[^6]   Every violent-injury or assault-related death in the CDC WONDER database originates from a coroner/ME determination and is reported via the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This reporting is universal and mandatory. (Coroners/medical examiners (C/ME) are the legal authority for certifying cause and manner of death, but they often draw on law enforcement information as part of that determination.)

There is a distinction between the UCR's "homicide" and CDC's "assault" definitions. UCR's homicide definition excludes justifiable homicides (legal intervention and self-defense). CDC defines assault as injuries intentionally inflicted by another person with intent to harm or kill. This includes self-defense killings but excludes legal intervention. The CDC codes for homicide expand the definition even further beyond the UCR definition (terrorism-related and sequelae of assault).[^13]

"The ICD-9 was used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates until 1999, when use of ICD-10 for mortality coding started."[^11]

"Likely related to several of the aforementioned factors, considerable variability exists across both states and countries in terms of the frequency and rates of deaths of undetermined intent.10,19 In many states, the undetermined category is used infrequently. In others, it represents a large proportion of violent deaths."[^12]

The change from IDC-9 to IDC-10 codes in 1999 saw the "undetermined" cause of death category expanded and split by mechanism. It is possible (but not studied here) that adaptations to changes in the IDC coding system in the early 2000's lead to more conservative categorization in coding edge cases, i.e. the IDC code change may have lead to more deaths ruled as "undetermined" for a period of time. This may explain the lower CDC assault counts compared to UCR as a factor separate from any baseline variations between police investigations and medical opinions.

Aside from these outlier patterns, based on the agency information given (UCR participation is voluntary, excludes justifiable homicides, etc.) we expect the UCR data to fall between the CDC total assault and assault-by-firearm data. In Mississippi it does not.

### Total Incident Counts in California, Mississippi, New York, and Texas (CIUS Reporting)

This is the data the JAG funding is based on (2018-2020), fiscal year 2024. Will they use 2022-2024 for FY 2025?

Judging from Mississippi alone, the UCR data is unusable.

### UCR Data From 2021 - 2025

They switched to another system. They failed to collect enough data in 2021. In 2022 they allowed data submission through the previous collection system to try stabilize data quality.
