	- [A Campus Guide To Identifying Antisemitism In A Time Of Perplexity](https://nexusproject.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/A-Campus-Guide-To-Identifying-Antisemitism-In-A-Time-Of-Perplexity.pdf)

	- "The guide assumes both that antisemitism is a real problem in our society and that not all harsh criticism of Israel is antisemitic. Indeed, political speech may be painful or offensive to people who identify strongly with Israel without being antisemitic."

		- When something is defined as subjectively offensive, they are no longer discriminating

	- "Just as Jewish students have felt attacked for supporting Israel, so too have students who support the pro-Palestine movement felt attacked for their views. They faced hostility from right-wing, pro-Israel counter-demonstrators, a deaf ear from university leaders and often violent responses from law enforcement. Moreover, they were frequently accused of being antisemitic because of their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel even though a noticeable contingent of Jews participated in the protests."

	- His questions regarding antisemitism are narrower than the Title VI guidelines on discrimination 

	- "For example, the guide maintains that the phrase “From the river to the sea” is not antisemitic if it’s proposing a single state in which all citizens, Jewish and Palestinian, have equal rights. By contrast, if the phrase is a call to eliminate Jews from the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean or to relegate them to second-class status, it is antisemitic."

	- UCLA was adding barricades, this was also stated in the DB, find it

	- "Across town at UCLA, scores of Palestinian supporters set up about 20 tents, created a perimeter around their “Palestine Solidarity Encampment” and peacefully protested day and night — all without arrests, suspensions or intervention by campus staff, who watched from the sidelines. Private security guards with bikes separated the pro-Palestinian group from Israel supporters, and UCLA eventually added metal barricades after counter-protesters repeatedly tried to breach the encampment and in at least one case witnessed by The Times entered and shoved a woman to the ground."

	- "The director of UCLA’s Nazarian Center, a nexus for both social and political Israeli studies, took to X on Saturday to voice support for those who oppose Israel’s blockade and destruction of Gaza. But Dov Waxman drew the line at a demand for UCLA to sever connections to Israeli universities and foreign study programs."

	- "“The Center is devoted to the academic study of Israel and has no ties to the Israeli government,” Waxman wrote. Further, Waxman singled out one of the groups he said is organizing campus protests, Students for Justice in Palestine. Waxman said the group has voiced support for Hamas."

	- "USC’s campus has been closed to the general public since Friday, with access restricted to residents and registered visitors. Further steps were hinted at with the approach of commencement ceremonies starting May 8. The traditional central ceremony has been canceled but separate events for individual schools are still planned."

	- "Across the lawn, demonstrators carried signs that ranged from a handmade “Free Hugs Jewish Students” to pre-printed “I go bananas for Israel” — a taunt aimed at reports of someone with a banana allergy in the pro-Palestinian encampment, now encircled by a protective wall of plywood. Through gaps in the wood, a person waved a large Palestinian flag."

		- [Campus safety report 2022](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/Public-Safety-Report), not sure if this is related to the above

	- "Drake’s safety plan states: “The University will reinforce existing guidelines that minimize police presence at protests, follow de-escalation methods in the event of violence and seek non-urgent mutual aid first from UC campuses before calling outside law enforcement agencies.”"

	- "“My office has requested a detailed accounting from the campus about what transpired in the early morning hours today,” Drake said on Tuesday. “But some confusion remains. Therefore, we are also ordering an independent external review of both UCLA’s planning and actions, and the effectiveness of the mutual aid response.”"

	- "At about 4 a.m. Wednesday, a small group of student journalists for the Daily Bruin, including Christopher Buchanan, a student fellow for the CalMatters College Journalism Network, were confronted by a group of counterprotesters who began berating them. They targeted the staff’s news editor, calling her names, and blocked the journalists’ route to the Daily Bruin office. One shined a strobe light into Buchanan’s face while others attacked him as he fell to the ground.

		“After I was struck and debilitated, I was surrounded by four to seven counterprotesters who proceeded to punch and kick my head and torso for thirty seconds to a minute,” Buchanan said. “I didn’t sustain any internal injuries, but I was badly bruised on the body and face.”

		Buchanan said this all happened within earshot of CHP officials, who did nothing to intervene."

	- "UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich described the decision to involve five law enforcement departments as “a standard response” for situations where the campus needs support while simultaneously describing the protest as a “very peaceful environment.” He attributed the police response to potential trespassing violations from people not affiliated with the university.

		“This isn’t a free speech issue, this is a trespassing issue,” Vasich said."

		- Why then were non-affiliates not given this treatment at UCLA?

		- [This Chancellor Update](https://chancellor.uci.edu/communications/campus/2024/240429-campus-activity-update.php) from UC Irvine is enlightening 

			- I believe in this case, "non-affiliates are pro-Palestinian protesters"

			- The non-affiliates at UCLA were carrying weapons, harassing and spewing hate speech, getting aggressive and physical---none of this qualifies as trespassing? 

			- He negotiated with the encampment, at least

	- “The University of California has consistently opposed calls for boycotts against and divestment from Israel,” the statement said. “While the University affirms the right of our community members to express diverse viewpoints, a boycott of this sort impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses.”

	- "In 2011, the Occupy Wall Street protests at UC Davis drew international attention when peaceful activists were pepper sprayed by the university’s police department. In the end, students won a $1 million settlement from UC Davis."

	- "The 2021 safety plan instituted data dashboards, police advisory boards, mental health responders and professional accreditation for individual police departments. According to the UC’s director of community safety, Jody Stiger, all 10 campuses are expected to put the plan into action — with the final, delayed step being professional accreditation for campus law enforcement agencies — by the end of this year."

	Consultation Periods](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/gold-book-systemwide-review.pdf)

		- "The “Systemwide Response Teams” policy was drafted based on recommendation by the Robinson/Edley report
		to create specialized response teams to respond to crown management situations. A proposed Systemwide
		Response Team policy underwent Management Consultation in 2017, as well as review by the
		UCFW. However, it was put on hold pending the recommendations of the President’s Police Task Force"

	- "The most concerning changes come in the form of the university’s new crowd management, or Systemwide Response Team, which has been likened to a form of UC national guard by prominent abolitionist groups such as the Divest/Invest UCLA Faculty Collective. According to the proposal, the SRT will be issued riot gear, arrest kits, chemical agents and kinetic energy projectiles. The team would be a UC-wide group of police officers exceeding the size of a police force on any single campus."

	- "Just last month, the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies released research showing that less than 10% of police calls at UCLA involve force, violence or even threats of violence. And even if UCLA did have more calls involving violence or crime, data has shown that increased police presence is not correlated with decreased crime."

	- "There have been studies upon studies showing that policing disproportionately harms people of color as well as other marginalized groups."

		- Why after the lessons learned with the occupy wallstreet and George Floyd protest activity, is UCLA policing disproportionately?

	- "Rick Braziel, associate vice chancellor for the Office of Campus Safety, said an issue the university ran into with its law enforcement for the spring protests is that they did not anticipate every scenario that could happen and plan the appropriate responses. He added that the hasty response time required for the protests made it so the university was “scrambling” to find law enforcement, hiring people at a rate that could have been lower with ample preparation."
