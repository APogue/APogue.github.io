- [SECOND REPORT OF THE UCLA TASK FORCE ON ANTI-PALESTINIAN, ANTIMUSLIM AND ANTI-ARAB RACISM: THE MILITARIZATION OF CAMPUS](https://racialviolencehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/June-28-Task-Force-Report-on-AntiPalestinian-Racism.pdf)

	- Looks like the authors are university professors, [Gaye Theresa Johnson](https://afam.ucla.edu/person/gaye-theresa-johnson/)

	- The letter goes through the students' intentions wrt the protest on June 10th

	- "Chancellor Block created the office unilaterally, without a search, a vetting process, faculty or 
	staff input—and not even a consideration that Braziel’s appointment might be temporary or 
	interim. "

	- Pp. 6 costs of policing 

	- Pp. 11 laws around aiming projectiles to disperse crowds

	- Based on video footage the description of police brutality is exaggerated 

	- "Then at one point a UCPD officer shot a student in the chest with a rubber bullet from a distance of 
	about five feet away, surely a violation of the rules for the use of such armaments, which can be 
	lethal at such ranges. The force of the bullet knocked them down and two fellow students assisted 
	them to safety through the bushes. The student suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised 
	lung and was taken by car to the ER at Ronald Reagan Hospital. They remained there for two 
	days given the severity of the injury, which caused elevated cardiac enzymes. This situation could 
	have ended with a permanent disability or death and is a stark reminder of why it is so dangerous 
	to simply transfer control of campus to a militarized police force. Other students were injured as 
	well, one suffering from a concussion, others from bruises and lacerations.3"

		- "UCLA Associate professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student had to go to the hospital after they were hit with a rubber bullet. 

			“They were shot in the chest from 10-15 feet range,” Blair told The Hill."

		- "Many eyewitness reports, including the experiences of several Dodd Hall occupants, as well as documentary video and photographic evidence, support the claim that the violence was incited by police and security, rather than the protesting students."

	- [Footage here shows the kettling](https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1800640869869228490?s=46&t=fKh9XATL-WMti11DkcbvEg) on June 10th

	- The above doc said they were given a dispersal order then kettled. The police press release does say they essentially moved the students around the campus. 

	- Braziel mentioned the best way to conceal security forces would be to put them in blue in gold polo shirts and hide them in buildings, this would effectively make campus feel more like campus. Clearly professors find that disruptive. 

- [Op-ed: Rick Braziel’s messaging belies disregard for police accountability, student safety](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/18/op-ed-rick-braziels-messaging-belies-disregard-for-police-accountability-student-safety)

	- "It’s not clear if he understands the function and nature of life on a university campus: He seems to regard student protest as inherently illegitimate and illegal by default; his reactive impulse to any sign of student activism is to police violence as a first response."

	- "Since the university has contracted several different security companies – some with murky reputations – and there were several different law enforcement agencies on campus, it was difficult to tell who was actually in charge, or whether, having washed its hands of its duty of care to its own students, the upper administration was content to have handed over campus to a loose confederation of police officers acting more or less on their own volition."

	- In claiming that protestors “prevented students from completing their final exams” or “entering classrooms,” he again ignores the fact that there would have been no disruptions to campus activities if the students had not been forced to relocate from one site to another by the police – and that the police themselves, not the students, were the ones blocking access to buildings and facilities and evicting students and instructors while exams were underway.

		- It can't be proven whether their encampments were blocking free access to campus, so the above may be only partially true

	- "What stands out above all in Braziel’s message, in fact, is his total disregard for our students, his contempt for their right to express themselves and his inability to recognize that UCLA is a university, not an armed camp run by militarized police."

	- "If June 10’s protest was “not peaceful,” as Braziel states, it was because of the police. And if “the campus community belongs to all of us and we must model the respect we expect to receive from others,” then Braziel and his junta should expect nothing less than continued escalation unless they try to adapt themselves to the norms of our community, rather than trying to compress us into theirs."

	- "In any case, although Braziel has supplanted the recognized authorities on our campus – above all the now silent and invisible chancellor and provost – his reckless disregard for our students and our values is ultimately their responsibility."

	- "We demand that they bring their policemen back under their control, that they restore cultural, political and intellectual order to our campus community by protecting rather than punishing expression and protest, and that they take steps to allow this community to breathe freely once more by reducing or eliminating – rather than enhancing – the police presence on campus."

- The main issue with the arrests is, while the encampments were illegal, and looked like they were building barricades, the arrests and disruptions came from the "kettling" incident. 

- [UCLA police chief reassigned after security failures over pro-Palestinian protests](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-22/ucla-police-chief-reassigned-after-security-failures-over-pro-palestinian-protests)

	- There are several sources "not authorized to speak publicly" that are doing UCLA's damage control 

		- "“Given Chief Thomas’ mishandling of keeping our community safe and ear-splitting calls for him to step aside, this had to happen,” said one source, who was not authorized to speak publicly."

		- "Thomas had lost confidence within UCLA and among some outside law enforcement officials, who have criticized what they said was the police chief’s lack of proper planning, coordination and communication in creating a campus safety plan and securing enough officers to carry it out should violence occur at the encampment. Both the police chief and Michael Beck, the administrative vice chancellor who oversaw the police department and Office of Emergency Management at the time, have faced calls for their resignation. Braziel has taken over both of those units as chief safety officer."

		- Can't find any direct quotes from "LAPD leaders" in LA Times articles

			- "Several top LAPD leaders told The Times that Thomas had tarnished the reputation of Los Angeles law enforcement with what they called his lack of planning and poor communication with other agencies. They said they had to scramble for officers and wait until enough could be assembled to safely intervene at about 1:40 a.m."

	- ""This was not a simple protest. It was a riot.""---

		- "But one UC source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Thomas and other officers should have moved in to stop the violence with the forces they had. In the case of active shooter situations, the source said, police used to wait for a larger force with sharpshooting expertise to assemble, but now move in more quickly to save those in danger. A similar protocol should have been used to quell the mob attack."

		- "“Whoever gets there first has to go in,” the UC source said. “If you’re waiting while people are getting hit in the head, there is something wrong with the system. This was not a simple protest. It was a riot.”"


	- "Wade Stern, president of the Federated University Peace Officers Assn., in a statement."

		- "“What unfolded at UCLA calls into question whether UCLA complied with the guidelines to have in place senior administrators trained in crowd control response, with written plans for response that were the product of scenario training and consultation with its police department and outside law enforcement agencies,” said Stern, who is also an officer at UC Riverside. “The response to protests appears ad hoc and devoid of the structured planning mandated by the UC system.”"



- [UCLA’s top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-03/before-mob-attack-ucla-police-chief-was-ordered-to-create-security-plan-but-didnt-sources-say)

	- Anonymous sources weigh in

		- "Days earlier, campus leadership had directed Thomas to create a safety plan that would protect the UCLA community after the encampment was put up last week and began drawing agitators, the sources said. The chief was told to spare no expense to bring in other UC police officers, offer overtime and hire as many private security officers needed to keep the peace."

		- This seems consistent with UC Systemwide Response Team mutual aid, meant for potentially taking the encampment down

	- Thomas advised leadership to take encampments down 

		- "But university leadership, he said, decided to allow the tents “as an expression of students’ 1st Amendment rights” and directed that police not be included in any security plan. Under UC’s systemwide community safety plan, police are deployed as a last resort — guidance developed after UC Davis police pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters in 2011, setting off a firestorm of controversy and an internal review that changed campus practices."

		- This is corroborated by the Mary Osako Newsroom Announcement, April 26, 2024---"It’s also important to note that we are following University of California systemwide policy guidance, which directs us not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community."

		- "As a result, Thomas said he developed a plan that relied on private security and made sure to alert the Los Angeles Police Department of the need to respond immediately should problems arise. The private security guards, who were not authorized to make arrests, were instructed to contact UCLA police if needed."

	- Sources show administration tried to pass the buck when the state of campus safety was unknown

		- "However, sources said he was directed to provide a written safety strategy outlining the response and preparation for various scenarios, such as a rally, skirmishes or violence — with the direction to do what was needed to keep the community safe — and he failed to deliver."

		- Is this the first time this was asked of him?

		- There is a big difference between "violence" and a riot

		- "Sources" seem to be choosing a PR term for what was clearly a riot

	- The truth is the administration was unprepared, and as the first line of oversight of student body activity, if they did not know now dangerous the situation had become, there was no way Thomas was going to know

		- "He acknowledged that he did tell leadership that it would take just minutes to deploy police forces, but he was referring to a general response — not a force large enough to handle the size of the crowds that clashed that night. But three sources confirmed he was directly asked how long it would take for outside law enforcement to quell any violence."

		- Violence is not a riot

	- "The campus police chief reports to Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck, who oversees the UCLA Police Department, the Office of Emergency Management and other campus operations."

	- Here there was an obvious mistake on the part of campus leadership

		- "As altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. He could not recall exactly when that occurred, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to secure their assistance."

		- "But he said the LAPD told him there was a problem with the payment system between the city and state, so the arrangements “couldn’t be done by the time of the attack.”"

		- Where is the system redundancy in case of something like this? Why was this done at the last minute? 

	- Thomas watching a Dodgers game? He clearly had no idea how serious the situation was, it was up to the administration to relay this intel 

		- "On the Tuesday night of the attack, Thomas said he was home watching the Dodgers game when he was alerted to the problems by Beck. He said he immediately called the LAPD’s West L.A. station and asked the watch commander to deploy resources. Then he called UCLA’s watch commander and instructed him to call in mutual aid assistance from law enforcement with the cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica and sheriff’s deputies."

	- Here Thomas is lacking adequate riot training

		- "Thomas said he arrived on campus shortly before midnight and found that 19 officers from UCLA, the LAPD and three of the mutual aid agencies had arrived but had not moved in to quell the violence. When he asked why, he said an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small. Thomas said he asked why they couldn’t go in with the forces they had, and the lieutenant told him he was directed to wait."

		- He did in fact have enough supplemental police for a "general response"

	- Here is where statements from the Mayor Bass are relevant

		- "It took more than 90 minutes for sufficient forces to arrive and intervene. Thomas said it usually takes an hour or even two to amass “mobile field forces” large enough — 50 officers or more from all over the city — to handle situations like the melee at UCLA."

		- "The police chief’s remarks offered the first responses to key questions, including when officials decided to bring in help from other agencies and whether help could have arrived sooner. Outside police forces generally do not enter the campus without the university’s approval, since it functions as an independent municipal entity although it is on state land."

	- This was around the time Osako said they did not want to involve law enforcement, so it makes sense this backup was about taking the encampment down

		- "The mutual aid requests made Thursday and Friday, April 25-26 — which would have provided UCLA with more officers as they dealt with the camp and a dueling area erected by pro-Israel activists — were both canceled. Thomas said he made the requests because the university was tentatively planning to take down the encampment then, but he canceled them when that plan was delayed."

		- "The responsibility to call for mutual aid through the UC Systemwide Response Team — a group of about 80 officers across the 10 campuses — has to be made by the host university’s chief of police, according to the UC police procedures manual.

	- He, like the students, clearly did not understand the severity of the situation. They were not made aware by the administration 

		- "He said he did not make any additional request after that because there was no specific reason for it at the time, but he directed his watch commander to do so immediately after learning about the attack, which he said was a “spontaneous” event. Critics are asking why he did not make another request sooner than that, after specific instances of physical altercations on Sunday and Monday."

		- "The union issued a statement this week placing the responsibility for the UC police response in the hands of “campus leadership,” saying the strategic direction was controlled by administrators. The three sources said, however, that such direction to prepare a plan, with enough officers to ensure safety, was given to Thomas multiple times."

- Ultimately the chief of police was blamed here

	- The impending or possible danger wasn't made clear to the chief of police by the administration, we know this because it wasn't made clear to the students. 

	- If administrative moves were truly being made for riot preparedness, why wasn't there any transparency with respect to this process? In real time? 

	- The reason the chief said "general response", is because *he didn't know* how out of hand things were going to get and he was not made aware that this was a possibility.

	- If it were the case that he needed to come up with a strategic plan for several scenarios, he clearly did not have the training to do so (nor was there redundancy in the event of failure either by a single individual or an interdepartmental logjam).

	- Evidence shows huge police responses at Regents meetings, etc. A last minute call for a task no one could have been prepared for without prior training or protocol was an exercise in passing the buck when the state of campus safety was completely unknown. 

	- And to hire Braziel (there is no Office of Campus Safety, and there is no Accountability Report and Braziel's term is over, just got extended) and point an abundance of force at encampments is treating UCLA like every other campus, and it is not (cite UCLA statistics for violence at protests which is low).

	- This is not a case of citations and rough handling of students to clear encampments, and this is not a case of resolving safety issues by making them "unlawful." The issue here is the environment in which this campus exists can be unsafe for protesting students. And you can point as many police at congregating students as you wish, or clear encampments as much as you wish, but that does not solve the problem. 

	- This is a case of tensions flaring, embroiling both sides in conflict due to administrative negligence.

	- The more downstream force they use to smother the symptoms of problems now deeply rooted in these factions the worse the situation will become. It is a pressure cooker that will require more and more force hold back, indefinitely. 

- Show the video of CHP on June 10th, was this what Thomas was supposed to have mobilized, standing at the ready, in the event of a riot? 

- Because that was the number of officers necessary to quell the "violence" that evening

- That is what Braziel did on June 10th, and according to his most recent LA Times interview, he considers his job thus far a success 

- Based on their inability to address the elephant in the room at UCLA presently, treating students as an outlandish, violent mob, shows they would never have been ready for the April 30th riots. Because the UCLA students are not an outlandish, violent mob. So neither Thomas or anyone else would assume that an army would be necessary to control them. And neither Thomas or anyone else should be expected to prepare an army for a phantom militia---

- What they wanted Thomas to address was an elephant in the room. His failure to pick up what they were implying and direct resources at it is now what is being called "a failure" on his part. 

- When January 6th occurred at our nation's capital did we blame Capitol Police? Did we blame [Nancy Pelosi](https://cha.house.gov/2024/8/new-obtained-hbo-footage-shows-pelosi-again-taking-responsibility-for-capitol-security-on-january-6) for not beefing up security beyond that of any other congressional count and certification? No, Trump incited a violent mob to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. That mob was thereafter held accountable, not Congress. Even if Congress has members some would consider despicable, that is irrelevant. That mob was years in the making. The result of systemic issues that run deep in the various factions that make up this country. 

- What the police did do on June 10th, is serve as a deterrent for counter-protesters. A few showed up, but nothing came of it. But there is no telling whether June 10th could have ended like April 30th (or the days before) had the police not been there. Will they be mobilizing these forces preemptively every time? Spending this money every time? Directing the forces at students and creating collateral damage every time? The collateral damage is exactly that, collateral damage that UCLA is dragging out for the public to view as justice served. 

- The non-affiliates need to be addressed, explicitly. 

- The barricades that continually go up, even for small encampments, are likely meant for agitators and counter-protesters, not police or students. Or is it to keep "Zionists" out? Or are the Zionists counter-protesters? While actions in April felt broader than a move simply for the sake of safety, if the students have to protect themselves from bodily harm either way, then any attempt to protest without the barricades and exclusion, as many students may be willing to do, would put their safety is at risk. Because no one will address the safety to students as its own separate issue, these broad, umbrella policies meant to keep the peace are really serving to chill free speech activities on campus. The reason UCLA decided to allow the encampment in the first place was because they wanted to be part of the national conversation. They wanted the spotlight partially on them. As policing and policy continue to be layered on, without addressing the real issues, UCLA will never again be part of this conversation, or potentially any other. Meanwhile Columbia shut their campus down to non-affiliates in a move that directly addresses an issue causing chaos and unsafe conditions on campus. That acknowledgement, in whatever form appropriate for UCLA, is vitally important. 






- The three temporally parallel but spatially sequential threads 

	- Administrative negligence---

		- Safety is an issue

		- Students cannot govern themselves

		- The conversation around the issues 

			- follow the etymology of "Zionist"
