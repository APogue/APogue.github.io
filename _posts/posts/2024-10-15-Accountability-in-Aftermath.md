		- "The “Systemwide Response Teams” policy was drafted based on recommendation by the Robinson/Edley report
		to create specialized response teams to respond to crown management situations. A proposed Systemwide
		Response Team policy underwent Management Consultation in 2017, as well as review by the
		UCFW. However, it was put on hold pending the recommendations of the President’s Police Task Force"

	- "The most concerning changes come in the form of the university’s new crowd management, or Systemwide Response Team, which has been likened to a form of UC national guard by prominent abolitionist groups such as the Divest/Invest UCLA Faculty Collective. According to the proposal, the SRT will be issued riot gear, arrest kits, chemical agents and kinetic energy projectiles. The team would be a UC-wide group of police officers exceeding the size of a police force on any single campus."

	- "Just last month, the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies released research showing that less than 10% of police calls at UCLA involve force, violence or even threats of violence. And even if UCLA did have more calls involving violence or crime, data has shown that increased police presence is not correlated with decreased crime."

	- "There have been studies upon studies showing that policing disproportionately harms people of color as well as other marginalized groups."

		- Why after the lessons learned with the occupy wallstreet and George Floyd protest activity, is UCLA policing disproportionately?

	- "Rick Braziel, associate vice chancellor for the Office of Campus Safety, said an issue the university ran into with its law enforcement for the spring protests is that they did not anticipate every scenario that could happen and plan the appropriate responses. He added that the hasty response time required for the protests made it so the university was “scrambling” to find law enforcement, hiring people at a rate that could have been lower with ample preparation."
