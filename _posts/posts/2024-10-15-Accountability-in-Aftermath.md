	- Looks like the authors are university professors, [Gaye Theresa Johnson](https://afam.ucla.edu/person/gaye-theresa-johnson/)

	- The letter goes through the students' intentions wrt the protest on June 10th

	- "Chancellor Block created the office unilaterally, without a search, a vetting process, faculty or 
	staff input—and not even a consideration that Braziel’s appointment might be temporary or 
	interim. "

	- Pp. 6 costs of policing 

	- Pp. 11 laws around aiming projectiles to disperse crowds

	- Based on video footage the description of police brutality is exaggerated 

	- "Then at one point a UCPD officer shot a student in the chest with a rubber bullet from a distance of 
	about five feet away, surely a violation of the rules for the use of such armaments, which can be 
	lethal at such ranges. The force of the bullet knocked them down and two fellow students assisted 
	them to safety through the bushes. The student suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised 
	lung and was taken by car to the ER at Ronald Reagan Hospital. They remained there for two 
	days given the severity of the injury, which caused elevated cardiac enzymes. This situation could 
	have ended with a permanent disability or death and is a stark reminder of why it is so dangerous 
	to simply transfer control of campus to a militarized police force. Other students were injured as 
	well, one suffering from a concussion, others from bruises and lacerations.3"

		- "UCLA Associate professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student had to go to the hospital after they were hit with a rubber bullet. 

			“They were shot in the chest from 10-15 feet range,” Blair told The Hill."

		- "Many eyewitness reports, including the experiences of several Dodd Hall occupants, as well as documentary video and photographic evidence, support the claim that the violence was incited by police and security, rather than the protesting students."

	- [Footage here shows the kettling](https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1800640869869228490?s=46&t=fKh9XATL-WMti11DkcbvEg) on June 10th

	- The above doc said they were given a dispersal order then kettled. The police press release does say they essentially moved the students around the campus. 

	- Braziel mentioned the best way to conceal security forces would be to put them in blue in gold polo shirts and hide them in buildings, this would effectively make campus feel more like campus. Clearly professors find that disruptive. 

- [Op-ed: Rick Braziel’s messaging belies disregard for police accountability, student safety](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/18/op-ed-rick-braziels-messaging-belies-disregard-for-police-accountability-student-safety)

	- "It’s not clear if he understands the function and nature of life on a university campus: He seems to regard student protest as inherently illegitimate and illegal by default; his reactive impulse to any sign of student activism is to police violence as a first response."

	- "Since the university has contracted several different security companies – some with murky reputations – and there were several different law enforcement agencies on campus, it was difficult to tell who was actually in charge, or whether, having washed its hands of its duty of care to its own students, the upper administration was content to have handed over campus to a loose confederation of police officers acting more or less on their own volition."

	- In claiming that protestors “prevented students from completing their final exams” or “entering classrooms,” he again ignores the fact that there would have been no disruptions to campus activities if the students had not been forced to relocate from one site to another by the police – and that the police themselves, not the students, were the ones blocking access to buildings and facilities and evicting students and instructors while exams were underway.

		- It can't be proven whether their encampments were blocking free access to campus, so the above may be only partially true

	- "What stands out above all in Braziel’s message, in fact, is his total disregard for our students, his contempt for their right to express themselves and his inability to recognize that UCLA is a university, not an armed camp run by militarized police."

	- "If June 10’s protest was “not peaceful,” as Braziel states, it was because of the police. And if “the campus community belongs to all of us and we must model the respect we expect to receive from others,” then Braziel and his junta should expect nothing less than continued escalation unless they try to adapt themselves to the norms of our community, rather than trying to compress us into theirs."

	- "In any case, although Braziel has supplanted the recognized authorities on our campus – above all the now silent and invisible chancellor and provost – his reckless disregard for our students and our values is ultimately their responsibility."

	- "We demand that they bring their policemen back under their control, that they restore cultural, political and intellectual order to our campus community by protecting rather than punishing expression and protest, and that they take steps to allow this community to breathe freely once more by reducing or eliminating – rather than enhancing – the police presence on campus."

- The main issue with the arrests is, while the encampments were illegal, and looked like they were building barricades, the arrests and disruptions came from the "kettling" incident. 

- [UCLA police chief reassigned after security failures over pro-Palestinian protests](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-22/ucla-police-chief-reassigned-after-security-failures-over-pro-palestinian-protests)

	- There are several sources "not authorized to speak publicly" that are doing UCLA's damage control 

		- "“Given Chief Thomas’ mishandling of keeping our community safe and ear-splitting calls for him to step aside, this had to happen,” said one source, who was not authorized to speak publicly."

		- "Thomas had lost confidence within UCLA and among some outside law enforcement officials, who have criticized what they said was the police chief’s lack of proper planning, coordination and communication in creating a campus safety plan and securing enough officers to carry it out should violence occur at the encampment. Both the police chief and Michael Beck, the administrative vice chancellor who oversaw the police department and Office of Emergency Management at the time, have faced calls for their resignation. Braziel has taken over both of those units as chief safety officer."

		- Can't find any direct quotes from "LAPD leaders" in LA Times articles

			- "Several top LAPD leaders told The Times that Thomas had tarnished the reputation of Los Angeles law enforcement with what they called his lack of planning and poor communication with other agencies. They said they had to scramble for officers and wait until enough could be assembled to safely intervene at about 1:40 a.m."

	- ""This was not a simple protest. It was a riot.""---

		- "But one UC source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Thomas and other officers should have moved in to stop the violence with the forces they had. In the case of active shooter situations, the source said, police used to wait for a larger force with sharpshooting expertise to assemble, but now move in more quickly to save those in danger. A similar protocol should have been used to quell the mob attack."

		- "“Whoever gets there first has to go in,” the UC source said. “If you’re waiting while people are getting hit in the head, there is something wrong with the system. This was not a simple protest. It was a riot.”"


	- "Wade Stern, president of the Federated University Peace Officers Assn., in a statement."

		- "“What unfolded at UCLA calls into question whether UCLA complied with the guidelines to have in place senior administrators trained in crowd control response, with written plans for response that were the product of scenario training and consultation with its police department and outside law enforcement agencies,” said Stern, who is also an officer at UC Riverside. “The response to protests appears ad hoc and devoid of the structured planning mandated by the UC system.”"

- [UCLA’s top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-03/before-mob-attack-ucla-police-chief-was-ordered-to-create-security-plan-but-didnt-sources-say)

	- Anonymous sources weigh in

		- "Days earlier, campus leadership had directed Thomas to create a safety plan that would protect the UCLA community after the encampment was put up last week and began drawing agitators, the sources said. The chief was told to spare no expense to bring in other UC police officers, offer overtime and hire as many private security officers needed to keep the peace."

		- This seems consistent with UC Systemwide Response Team mutual aid, meant for potentially taking the encampment down

	- Thomas advised leadership to take encampments down 

		- "But university leadership, he said, decided to allow the tents “as an expression of students’ 1st Amendment rights” and directed that police not be included in any security plan. Under UC’s systemwide community safety plan, police are deployed as a last resort — guidance developed after UC Davis police pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters in 2011, setting off a firestorm of controversy and an internal review that changed campus practices."

		- This is corroborated by the Mary Osako Newsroom Announcement, April 26, 2024---"It’s also important to note that we are following University of California systemwide policy guidance, which directs us not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community."

		- "As a result, Thomas said he developed a plan that relied on private security and made sure to alert the Los Angeles Police Department of the need to respond immediately should problems arise. The private security guards, who were not authorized to make arrests, were instructed to contact UCLA police if needed."

	- Sources show administration tried to pass the buck when the state of campus safety was unknown

		- "However, sources said he was directed to provide a written safety strategy outlining the response and preparation for various scenarios, such as a rally, skirmishes or violence — with the direction to do what was needed to keep the community safe — and he failed to deliver."

		- Is this the first time this was asked of him?

		- There is a big difference between "violence" and a riot

		- "Sources" seem to be choosing a PR term for what was clearly a riot

	- The truth is the administration was unprepared, and as the first line of oversight of student activity, if they did not know now dangerous the situation had become, there was no way Thomas was going to know

		- "He acknowledged that he did tell leadership that it would take just minutes to deploy police forces, but he was referring to a general response — not a force large enough to handle the size of the crowds that clashed that night. But three sources confirmed he was directly asked how long it would take for outside law enforcement to quell any violence."

		- Violence is not a riot

	- "The campus police chief reports to Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck, who oversees the UCLA Police Department, the Office of Emergency Management and other campus operations."

	- Here there was an obvious mistake on the part of campus leadership

		- "As altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. He could not recall exactly when that occurred, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to secure their assistance."

		- "But he said the LAPD told him there was a problem with the payment system between the city and state, so the arrangements “couldn’t be done by the time of the attack.”"

		- Where is the system redundancy in case of something like this? Why was this done at the last minute? 

	- Thomas watching a Dodgers game? He clearly had no idea how serious the situation was, it was up to the administration to relay this intel 

		- Where does the intel come from? Student Affairs staff. They are the liasons from the ground to the administration. They were even there the day that the students were confronted by violent aggressors in Oct 2023.

		- "On the Tuesday night of the attack, Thomas said he was home watching the Dodgers game when he was alerted to the problems by Beck. He said he immediately called the LAPD’s West L.A. station and asked the watch commander to deploy resources. Then he called UCLA’s watch commander and instructed him to call in mutual aid assistance from law enforcement with the cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica and sheriff’s deputies."

	- Here Thomas is lacking adequate riot training

		- "Thomas said he arrived on campus shortly before midnight and found that 19 officers from UCLA, the LAPD and three of the mutual aid agencies had arrived but had not moved in to quell the violence. When he asked why, he said an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small. Thomas said he asked why they couldn’t go in with the forces they had, and the lieutenant told him he was directed to wait."

		- He did in fact have enough supplemental police for a "general response"

	- Here is where statements from the Mayor Bass are relevant

		- "It took more than 90 minutes for sufficient forces to arrive and intervene. Thomas said it usually takes an hour or even two to amass “mobile field forces” large enough — 50 officers or more from all over the city — to handle situations like the melee at UCLA."

		- "The police chief’s remarks offered the first responses to key questions, including when officials decided to bring in help from other agencies and whether help could have arrived sooner. Outside police forces generally do not enter the campus without the university’s approval, since it functions as an independent municipal entity although it is on state land."

	- This was around the time Osako said they did not want to involve law enforcement, so it makes sense this backup was about taking the encampment down

		- "The mutual aid requests made Thursday and Friday, April 25-26 — which would have provided UCLA with more officers as they dealt with the camp and a dueling area erected by pro-Israel activists — were both canceled. Thomas said he made the requests because the university was tentatively planning to take down the encampment then, but he canceled them when that plan was delayed."

			- What about the notice to vacate on April 30th? How did that communication break down? Did they just assume Thomas was aware and prepared? Or were they relying on the "general response?"

		- "The responsibility to call for mutual aid through the UC Systemwide Response Team — a group of about 80 officers across the 10 campuses — has to be made by the host university’s chief of police, according to the UC police procedures manual.

			- Wade says they haven't been trained since 2020, does that include the chief? 

			- See how [this doc](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/gold-book-systemwide-review.pdf) relates

			- [Universitywide Police Policies And Administrative Procedures](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000382/PoliceProceduresManual)

	- He, like the students, clearly did not understand the severity of the situation. They were not made aware by the administration 

		- "He said he did not make any additional request after that because there was no specific reason for it at the time, but he directed his watch commander to do so immediately after learning about the attack, which he said was a “spontaneous” event. Critics are asking why he did not make another request sooner than that, after specific instances of physical altercations on Sunday and Monday."

		- "The union issued a statement this week placing the responsibility for the UC police response in the hands of “campus leadership,” saying the strategic direction was controlled by administrators. The three sources said, however, that such direction to prepare a plan, with enough officers to ensure safety, was given to Thomas multiple times."

	- "Stern’s union put out a statement Wednesday noting that the police departments across the UC system take their orders from the chancellors of the schools."

	- "“When protests erupt on campus, the decisions regarding the response of the UC Police rest firmly in the hands of campus leadership,” the union said in a statement."

	- "The union noted the difference between “operational execution,” which was under the departments, compared to “strategic direction,” which was controlled by the school administrators, according to the statement."

	- "The guide assumes both that antisemitism is a real problem in our society and that not all harsh criticism of Israel is antisemitic. Indeed, political speech may be painful or offensive to people who identify strongly with Israel without being antisemitic."

		- When something is defined as subjectively offensive, they are no longer discriminating

	- "Just as Jewish students have felt attacked for supporting Israel, so too have students who support the pro-Palestine movement felt attacked for their views. They faced hostility from right-wing, pro-Israel counter-demonstrators, a deaf ear from university leaders and often violent responses from law enforcement. Moreover, they were frequently accused of being antisemitic because of their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel even though a noticeable contingent of Jews participated in the protests."

	- His questions regarding antisemitism are narrower than the Title VI guidelines on discrimination 

	- "For example, the guide maintains that the phrase “From the river to the sea” is not antisemitic if it’s proposing a single state in which all citizens, Jewish and Palestinian, have equal rights. By contrast, if the phrase is a call to eliminate Jews from the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean or to relegate them to second-class status, it is antisemitic."

	- UCLA was adding barricades, this was also stated in the DB, find it

	- "Across town at UCLA, scores of Palestinian supporters set up about 20 tents, created a perimeter around their “Palestine Solidarity Encampment” and peacefully protested day and night — all without arrests, suspensions or intervention by campus staff, who watched from the sidelines. Private security guards with bikes separated the pro-Palestinian group from Israel supporters, and UCLA eventually added metal barricades after counter-protesters repeatedly tried to breach the encampment and in at least one case witnessed by The Times entered and shoved a woman to the ground."

- [Dueling Gaza protests at UCLA draw hundreds as USC sees peaceful demonstration](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-28/gaza-ucla-usc-protests)

	- "The director of UCLA’s Nazarian Center, a nexus for both social and political Israeli studies, took to X on Saturday to voice support for those who oppose Israel’s blockade and destruction of Gaza. But Dov Waxman drew the line at a demand for UCLA to sever connections to Israeli universities and foreign study programs."

	- "“The Center is devoted to the academic study of Israel and has no ties to the Israeli government,” Waxman wrote. Further, Waxman singled out one of the groups he said is organizing campus protests, Students for Justice in Palestine. Waxman said the group has voiced support for Hamas."

	- "USC’s campus has been closed to the general public since Friday, with access restricted to residents and registered visitors. Further steps were hinted at with the approach of commencement ceremonies starting May 8. The traditional central ceremony has been canceled but separate events for individual schools are still planned."

	- "Across the lawn, demonstrators carried signs that ranged from a handmade “Free Hugs Jewish Students” to pre-printed “I go bananas for Israel” — a taunt aimed at reports of someone with a banana allergy in the pro-Palestinian encampment, now encircled by a protective wall of plywood. Through gaps in the wood, a person waved a large Palestinian flag."

	- The photo of the Oct 7th rally looks like Braziel has quite a few security guards on the premises 

	- "Braziel led a large behind-the-scenes operation that culminated in peaceful Oct. 7 protests"

	- "A tense moment came when pro-Palestinian supporters marched into a campus area off-limits to protest activities and initially refused to leave after student affairs staff told them they were violating campus rules.

		Police were called in. They determined protesters were not breaking any laws. The protesters moved on and the night ended with no arrests, no significant confrontations — and, in an intentional UCLA effort to create a calmer environment, no visible massive mobilization of police in riot gear wielding batons."

	- "But the university is trying to turn a corner with more effective policing and security protocols."

	- "In an interview with The Times, Braziel laid out his strategy for overhauling UCLA security operations — and responded to questions and criticism from faculty and others about his role, which is actually a $52,000-a-month short-term position."

	- "“My vision is a beautiful campus where people feel safe and comfortable with each other and police are seen as part of the family, not an invading army,” Braziel said. “It’s not a one-person fix. It’s going to take a whole team of experts from inside and outside the UCLA organization to create positive change.”"

	- "By far, the key concern expressed by many campus members is what they perceive as a “militarized” campus with too many police and security officers. Law enforcement officers have arrested more than 200 protesters, are working on about 50 related criminal cases and drew outrage when they used batons, pepper balls and sponge rounds fired from launchers — some of which badly injured several students — during protests in April, May and June."

	- "Anna Markowitz, an associate professor of education, said the heavy presence of officers standing around “in little packs” made the campus less comfortable, ramping up tensions and the potential for racial profiling. Another faculty member said he was shocked to count 14 officers in a half-mile walk through campus."

		- "“What’s the plan to get rid of this?” Markowitz said she asked at recent Academic Senate town hall with Braziel and Interim Chancellor Darnell Hunt. “Is there a plan?”"

		- "Braziel’s response during the town hall — putting security officers in friendlier blue-and-gold UCLA polo shirts instead of the black shirts that many currently wear — did not play well among faculty, who said he missed their larger concerns of the tense campus climate created by the stepped-up patrols."

	- Braziel's plan---

		- There are several points see article

		- "Integration: Campus police and civilian security officers need to become part of the campus, he said. It’s why he promoted the idea of UCLA-branded wear for civilian safety staff in the model of community policing that relies on strong relationships between security forces and those they serve."

	- "On Oct. 7, he said, he and his team had fully staffed up — deploying all 51 campus police officers available that day, tripling normal private security staffing to 158 officers, bringing some UC San Francisco officers to UCLA and requesting LAPD forces to stand by on campus."

	- "But he kept most of the officers out of sight inside buildings, close enough to intervene if needed but without presenting a negative “visual impact,” he said. Police had their riot gear ready but did not wear it, an intentional decision."

		"“If you dress for a riot, you’re going to get a riot,” Braziel said. “The visual is super important to the response you’re going to get.”"

	- "He declined to comment on why no university action was taken against pro-Palestinian students who refused to comply with protest rules on approved free speech zones and amplified-sound restrictions. He said police did not arrest anyone because protesters were not significantly disrupting campus operations, the trigger to declare an unlawful assembly and cite them if they refuse to leave."

	- "Ariela Gross, a UCLA law professor, was one of several who expressed concern about accountability as Braziel was hired so quickly into such a senior position to start a new administrative office without faculty input — as is generally required under UC’s system of shared governance.

		“When you see something thrown together in a couple of days that hasn’t been vetted but has enormous power, I have concerns,” Gross said. “There’s potential for abuse.”"

	- "But Braziel’s terms of employment are significantly different from public assumptions, based on Block’s announcement. He is not a permanent employee with multiple responsibilities related to campus safety. Braziel’s original contract, obtained by The Times, ended Aug. 31 and has been extended until the end of the year."

		"He said he hoped to have key changes in place with a plan to move forward to hand off to the incoming chancellor, Julio Frenk, who will take the reins Jan. 1."

	- "Braziel, 64, who lives in Sacramento, said he never had a desire or intention to move to Los Angeles for a long-term job. He said he agreed to a short-term contract to review UCLA’s protest management and suggest institutional changes to improve safety practices after first being contacted by the UC Office of the President and then Block. He said he understood his other job duties as helping UCLA through a peaceful commencement, and providing updates on security operations to Block..."

	- "“I’m the person coming in for just a few months, hopefully fix things, get them moving down the road and then somebody else takes over when I’m gone,” he said.

		Braziel said he never agreed to set up the new Office of Campus Safety or prepare a campus response plan for potential fall protests — tasks that each amount to full-time jobs themselves but that many expected him to take on. Creating the safety office, he said, would take several employees many months to create a website, complaint intake process, training curriculum, policies and procedures, compliance auditing, staffing and planning for such future events as the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles."

		"Braziel said he was given no staff or funding for either job but agreed to extend his contract after receiving approval to hire consultants to do them."

	- "The violence of the melee and encampment takedown was predictable, he said, looking at what was happening at Columbia University and other protest hot spots at the time — but UCLA was operating in reactive mode."

		"“We have to stop playing checkers where you’re waiting for something to happen and respond,” he said. “With chess, you’re constantly looking four, five moves down the board to anticipate what will happen so you can either avoid it or better respond to it.”"


- [UCLA administrators ignored UC policies and now engage in blame-shifting](https://www.dailynews.com/2024/05/08/ucla-administrators-ignored-uc-policies-and-now-engage-in-blame-shifting/)

	- [Robinson/Edley Report](https://campusprotestreport.universityofcalifornia.edu/documents/implementation-report.pdf)

	- "Ten years ago, the UC system created a comprehensive guide of roles, responsibilities, and planning for the UC system and individual campuses to follow in responding to civil disobedience on campuses. These guidelines remain in effect to this day."

	- "Central to these guidelines was the clear delineation of administrators’ and campus law enforcement roles in managing civil disobedience incidents."

	- "The guidelines state that campus policy must “require the participation of senior administrators in decision-making about any police response to civil disobedience; clearly define the respective roles of administrators (objectives) and police (tactics) in this process.”"

	- "Moreover, recognizing the pivotal role of campus administrators in protest response, the guidelines demanded that those administrators be well-trained in protest response."

	- "Moreover, recognizing the pivotal role of campus administrators in protest response, the guidelines demanded that those administrators be well-trained in protest response. Specifically, the guidelines required UCLA to “implement formal training of administrators . . .  This mandatory training was directed to be conducted annually, ensuring that current and best practices in protest response would be employed."

	- "joint simulations involving administrators and campus police to rehearse responses to potential civil disobedience scenarios."

		- "campus police were to undergo crowd management and mediation training"

		- "with an explicit directive that the initial response be handled internally before seeking assistance from outside law enforcement agencies."

	- "The role of UC police was emphasized, with officers trained in crowd management, mediation, and de-escalation. Additionally, the initial police response was restricted to campus police, with the additional directive that “each campus police agency [is] to seek aid first from other UC campuses before calling on outside law enforcement.”"

	- "Every UC campus was directed to establish a specialized response team to respond to major incidents on their campus and to respond to other campuses. Unfortunately, although those teams have been established, they have not been trained since 2020 because the UC system and its campuses refuse to fund such training."

		- These teams are brought up [in this](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/gold-book-systemwide-review.pdf) document 

		- Are these the teams that cleared the encampment? 

	- "Per the guidelines, UCLA was directed to create “a regular program for joint trainings, briefings and scenario planning with law enforcement agencies on which each campus police department is likely to call for assistance or mutual aid.”"

	- "The guidelines make clear that well before these protests, UCLA should have had in place trained administrators ready to implement specific, established, and well-rehearsed plans. Those plans should have covered in detail how both UCLA PD and any outside law enforcement would respond to civil disobedience on campus and who the senior administrators were who would make the call on when to execute any part of the plans."

	- "If this is not the case, then it should be easy for the UCLA administration to identify those administrators who undertook the required annual training in crowd management and response. UCLA can simply produce the plans developed before these protests, which guided their response, and demonstrate how the response dovetailed with those plans. Finally, the UCLA administration can also show how it met the required training, briefing, and scenario planning that it was ordered to undertake both with its own police department and outside agencies prior to these protests."

		- [Campus safety report 2022](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/Public-Safety-Report), not sure if this is related to the above

	- "Drake’s safety plan states: “The University will reinforce existing guidelines that minimize police presence at protests, follow de-escalation methods in the event of violence and seek non-urgent mutual aid first from UC campuses before calling outside law enforcement agencies.”"

	- "“My office has requested a detailed accounting from the campus about what transpired in the early morning hours today,” Drake said on Tuesday. “But some confusion remains. Therefore, we are also ordering an independent external review of both UCLA’s planning and actions, and the effectiveness of the mutual aid response.”"

	- "At about 4 a.m. Wednesday, a small group of student journalists for the Daily Bruin, including Christopher Buchanan, a student fellow for the CalMatters College Journalism Network, were confronted by a group of counterprotesters who began berating them. They targeted the staff’s news editor, calling her names, and blocked the journalists’ route to the Daily Bruin office. One shined a strobe light into Buchanan’s face while others attacked him as he fell to the ground.

		“After I was struck and debilitated, I was surrounded by four to seven counterprotesters who proceeded to punch and kick my head and torso for thirty seconds to a minute,” Buchanan said. “I didn’t sustain any internal injuries, but I was badly bruised on the body and face.”

		Buchanan said this all happened within earshot of CHP officials, who did nothing to intervene."

	- "UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich described the decision to involve five law enforcement departments as “a standard response” for situations where the campus needs support while simultaneously describing the protest as a “very peaceful environment.” He attributed the police response to potential trespassing violations from people not affiliated with the university.

		“This isn’t a free speech issue, this is a trespassing issue,” Vasich said."

		- Why then were non-affiliates not given this treatment at UCLA?

			- I believe in this case, "non-affiliates are pro-Palestinian protesters"

			- The non-affiliates at UCLA were carrying weapons, harassing and spewing hate speech, getting aggressive and physical---none of this qualifies as trespassing?

	- “The University of California has consistently opposed calls for boycotts against and divestment from Israel,” the statement said. “While the University affirms the right of our community members to express diverse viewpoints, a boycott of this sort impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses.”

	- "In 2011, the Occupy Wall Street protests at UC Davis drew international attention when peaceful activists were pepper sprayed by the university’s police department. In the end, students won a $1 million settlement from UC Davis."

	- "The 2021 safety plan instituted data dashboards, police advisory boards, mental health responders and professional accreditation for individual police departments. According to the UC’s director of community safety, Jody Stiger, all 10 campuses are expected to put the plan into action — with the final, delayed step being professional accreditation for campus law enforcement agencies — by the end of this year."

	- "The most concerning changes come in the form of the university’s new crowd management, or Systemwide Response Team, which has been likened to a form of UC national guard by prominent abolitionist groups such as the Divest/Invest UCLA Faculty Collective. According to the proposal, the SRT will be issued riot gear, arrest kits, chemical agents and kinetic energy projectiles. The team would be a UC-wide group of police officers exceeding the size of a police force on any single campus."

	- "Just last month, the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies released research showing that less than 10% of police calls at UCLA involve force, violence or even threats of violence. And even if UCLA did have more calls involving violence or crime, data has shown that increased police presence is not correlated with decreased crime."

	- "Rick Braziel, associate vice chancellor for the Office of Campus Safety, said an issue the university ran into with its law enforcement for the spring protests is that they did not anticipate every scenario that could happen and plan the appropriate responses. He added that the hasty response time required for the protests made it so the university was “scrambling” to find law enforcement, hiring people at a rate that could have been lower with ample preparation."


### Notes

- WRT June 10th arrests

	- These were in an effort to get campus under control before graduation

	- Braziel said more recently, that dispersal orders are given and arrests are made when they are ignored

	- It is clear that the students would not be able to disperse given the circumstances 

	- It is also the case that encampment barricades were put up in April by CSC 

	- What about Drake's original intent? With his campus security and safety plan meant to instill trust in the campus community? 

- New laws and rules in place

	- Encampments banned, facemasks banned

	- New time, place, manner policies

	- Posting requirements for anti-discrimination 

	- 4 point plan, with the above, to get funding from CA

	- There a couple more bills directed anti-discrimination training coming from CA gov't

	- Office of Campus Safety 

		- integration and ingratiation of UCPD, beefed up campus security, putting them in polos, hiding them in buildings

		- better communication system and efforts to take friendlier positions 

- Ultimately the chief of police was blamed here

	- The impending or possible danger wasn't made clear to the chief of police by the administration, we know this because it wasn't made clear to the students. 

	- If administrative moves were truly being made for riot preparedness, why wasn't there any transparency with respect to this process? In real time? 

	- The reason the chief said "general response", is because *he didn't know* how out of hand things were going to get and he was not made aware that this was a possibility.

	- If it were the case that he needed to come up with a strategic plan for several scenarios, he clearly did not have the training to do so (nor was there redundancy in the event of failure either by a single individual or an interdepartmental logjam).

	- Evidence shows huge police responses at Regents meetings, etc. A last minute call for a task no one could have been prepared for without prior training or protocol was an exercise in passing the buck when the state of campus safety was completely unknown. 

	- And to hire Braziel (there is no Office of Campus Safety, and there is no Accountability Report and Braziel's term is over, just got extended) and point an abundance of force at encampments is treating UCLA like every other campus, and it is not (cite UCLA statistics for violence at protests which is low).

	- This is not a case of citations and rough handling of students to clear encampments, and this is not a case of resolving safety issues by making them "unlawful." The issue here is the environment in which this campus exists can be unsafe for protesting students. And you can point as many police at congregating students as you wish, or clear encampments as much as you wish, but that does not solve the problem. 

	- This is a case of tensions flaring, embroiling both sides in conflict due to administrative negligence.

	- The more downstream force they use to smother the symptoms of problems now deeply rooted in these factions the worse the situation will become. It is a pressure cooker that will require more and more force hold back, indefinitely. 

- Show the video of CHP on June 10th, was this what Thomas was supposed to have mobilized, standing at the ready, in the event of a riot? 

- Because that was the number of officers necessary to quell the "violence" that evening

- That is what Braziel did on June 10th, and according to his most recent LA Times interview, he considers his job thus far a success 

- Based on their inability to address the elephant in the room at UCLA presently, treating students as an outlandish, violent mob, shows they would never have been ready for the April 30th riots. Because the UCLA students are not an outlandish, violent mob. So neither Thomas or anyone else would assume that an army would be necessary to control them. And neither Thomas or anyone else should be expected to prepare an army for a phantom militia---

- What they wanted Thomas to address was an elephant in the room. His failure to pick up what they were implying and direct resources at it is now what is being called "a failure" on his part. 

- When January 6th occurred at our nation's capital did we blame Capitol Police? Did we blame [Nancy Pelosi](https://cha.house.gov/2024/8/new-obtained-hbo-footage-shows-pelosi-again-taking-responsibility-for-capitol-security-on-january-6) for not beefing up security beyond that of any other congressional count and certification? No, Trump incited a violent mob to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. That mob was thereafter held accountable, not Congress. Even if Congress has members some would consider despicable, that is irrelevant. That mob was years in the making. The result of systemic issues that run deep in the various factions that make up this country. 

- What the police did do on June 10th, is serve as a deterrent for counter-protesters. A few showed up, but nothing came of it. But there is no telling whether June 10th could have ended like April 30th (or the days before) had the police not been there. Will they be mobilizing these forces preemptively every time? Spending this money every time? Directing the forces at students and creating collateral damage every time? The collateral damage is exactly that, collateral damage that UCLA is dragging out for the public to view as justice served. 

- The non-affiliates need to be addressed, explicitly. 

- The barricades that continually go up, even for small encampments, are likely meant for agitators and counter-protesters, not police or students. Or is it to keep "Zionists" out? Or are the Zionists counter-protesters? While actions in April were broader than a move simply for the sake of safety, if the students have to protect themselves from bodily harm either way, then any attempt to protest without the barricades and exclusion, as many students may be willing to do, would put their safety at risk. Because no one will address the safety to students as its own separate issue, these broad, umbrella policies meant to keep the peace are really serving to chill free speech activities on campus. The reason UCLA decided to allow the encampment in the first place was because they wanted to be part of the national conversation. They wanted the spotlight partially on them. As policing and policy continue to be layered on, without addressing the real issues, UCLA will never again be part of this conversation, or potentially any other. Meanwhile Columbia shut their campus down to non-affiliates in a move that directly addresses an issue causing chaos and unsafe conditions on campus. That acknowledgement, in whatever form appropriate for UCLA, is vitally important. 


- What happened between the administration and Thomas on April 30th? Did they alert him to the fact that campers were told to vacate? 

	- It is odd that he called for mutual aid on the 25th and 26th, because the administration was planning to "tentatively" clear the encampment.

	- Why then didn't he call for mutual aid on the days before the 30th? Is it because the decision to clear the encampment came on the 30th?

	- Why was he watching a Dodgers game on the night of the 30th? Was he aware of the vacate notification at all? Was he made aware of the mounting tension? Did he call mutual aid on the 30th expecting to clear the encampment days later? Did he call mutual aid at all? 

	- One possible scenario: Sunday and Monday tensions mounted, they decided *on Tuesday* to clear the encampment, thereby giving Thomas no prior notification, and relied on his "general response" forces in the event anything went wrong

	- They did not say *if you stay it could be unsafe*

		- They were relying on Thomas despite having no confirmed game plan 

		- They didn't want to demonize the counter-protesters, and were willing to risk the safety of the students 

		- They didn't want to admit that they miscalculated and were miscalculating the state of campus safety






- They have to stop vandalizing campus, that vandalization is very expensive. This is a give a little take a little situation. 

- The three temporally parallel but spatially sequential threads 

	- Administrative negligence---

		- Safety is an issue

		- Students cannot govern themselves

		- The conversation around the issues 

			- follow the etymology of "Zionist"
