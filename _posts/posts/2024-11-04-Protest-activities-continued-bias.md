Thesis2: The biased handling of protesters by the administration continues in the aftermath of the April Riot.

### June 10th protest

- FJP take 

- [SJP take](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8GD2LXSLM9/?hl=en&img_index=3), is interesting, because in the police press release they didn't explicitly say they gave dispersal orders near the law school.

	- "171.11 To the extent appropriate to the circumstances, to be free from University discipline for actions committed involuntarily or under duress."

### True disruptions to campus operations 

- Encampment blockading 

	- Reddit---people can't get to class, their jobs, disabled people are denied access to campus

- The marching through the halls with chants of "From the River to the Sea" (TikTok)

- The screen that UCLA permitted to stay without permit 

	- Reddit quote

	- [Hillel comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HqCOvk9-i0iW2xlYqvjQGyzjWDmIzjn/view), "There is a screen placed by community members at UCLA playing the horrors of October 7th on repeat--and we
	can’t learn over the constant noise of Jews being slaughtered. The wider community is prioritizing their own idea of
	activism over what Jewish students want. We want peace and a diplomatic resolution."




### Protests around the time that Ben Shapiro came to speak for Young Americans for Freedom and or aligning with Sukkot 

- [Ben Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO7iLqeXcks&ab_channel=YoungAmerica%27sFoundation) had a talk at around 6:30 PM on 10-21

- [Sukkot for Palestine announcement](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBZJ5g0Ph01/?hl=en&img_index=1), 10-21

	- Would things be different if they went to the SE corner of Dickson Court?

	- "In observance of the holiday of Sukkot, Jewish students at UCLA erected a Gaza Solidarity Sukkah. They adorned the Sukkah with handmade decorations, photos of anti-Zionist Jewish ancestors, and banners that read “Stop Arming Israel.” They were joined by other students of conscience, members of Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, who gathered to join in prayer and protest.

	Then, pro-genocide agitators and UCLA administrators tore their Sukkah down.

	First, agitators surrounded the Sukkah and taunted the students with slurs and threats. Then, police in riot gear then arrived to clear the area, allowing agitators to begin tearing down handmade decorations. Finally, facilities workers sent by UCLA admin completed the destruction of this sacred dwelling.

	In keeping with Jewish tradition, students intended to eat and sleep in the Sukkah—a ritual in remembrance of Jewish ancestors forced to live in temporary structures in the desert while fleeing slavery. This year, students could not separate their observance from the fact that tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to live in temporary shelters due to the Israeli military's mass destruction of homes in Gaza. Jewish students across the country are observing Sukkot by erecting solidarity Sukkahs dedicated to Gaza and to Palestinian liberation.

	As UCLA allowed for the destruction of a sacred Jewish religious structure, the truth was clear: the University does not care about actual experiences of antisemitism—only about how it can use concerns about the “safety” of Jewish students to suppress anyone who dares to speak out for Palestine.

	Over the past months, UCLA has chosen to further militarize the campus and criminalize speech and political activity instead of withdrawing its support for Israeli human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
	Despite threats from pro-genocide agitators and from UCLA police, students of conscience at UCLA remain committed to calling on their university to divest from the Israeli military which is destroying life in Gaza."---Was the encampment deemed "unsafe?" Or was it interfering with operations? What is the Robinson/Edley policy on civil disobedience? What does the ACLU lawsuit say about negotiating with a protest? (There's policy on it). The encampments are "unsafe" because they attract harassers.

		- These were completely peaceful circumstances

		- There have been no comments from Braziel, the Chancellor, or Osako

- [Daily Bruin up-to-min coverage](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/21/live-graduate-students-for-justice-in-palestine-demonstration)

	- "8:12 p.m.---Around 30 counter-protesters arrived in Dickson Court North and began to heckle pro-Palestine protesters. In response, pro-Palestine protesters attempted to form a line to prevent them from accessing the sukkah."

	- The arrested was referred to as a "demonstrator," is presumed a pro-Palestinian demonstrator

	- "3:05 p.m. – Chabad at UCLA and Alpha Epsilon Pi also set up a sukkah in Bruin Plaza on Monday morning. A fire marshal from UCFD did not respond to a request for comment as to whether that temporary structure is a fire hazard – which UCFD declared the sukkah in Dickson Court North to be."

		- Bruin Plaza is an approved area for public expression, not sure how that relates to fire code, but the Sukkahs were on the wrong side of Dickson Court

- [Braziel's handling of Oct 7](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-11/intense-ucla-policing-draws-scrutiny-as-security-chief-speaks-out-on-protests)

	- “He declined to comment on why no university action was taken against pro-Palestinian students who refused to comply with protest rules on approved free speech zones and amplified-sound restrictions. He said police did not arrest anyone because protesters were not significantly disrupting campus operations, the trigger to declare an unlawful assembly and cite them if they refuse to leave.”

	- The question becomes, if the Sukkahs are peaceful civil disobedience, that should be allowed if not disrupting campus operations, then what was disrupting operations? The counter-protesters that the Sukkahs attracted?
