- Title VI

    - “[Title VI]69 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title VI states that:

    No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” 70

- “Education and Title VI” page of the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights

    - Vague language wrt monitoring and compliance

    - Displays instead "Dear Colleague" letters as guidance

    - One dated May 25th 2023 covered discrimination based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics

        - “As we witness a nationwide rise in reports of antisemitic harassment, including in schools, I write to remind you of schools’ legal obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including Jewish students, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics."

        - Talks about fact sheet "Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics" 

        - "Schools must take immediate and appropriate action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile environment. OCR generally finds that a hostile environment exists where there is harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school."

        - If a hostile environment based on shared ancestry existed, and the school knew or should have known of the hostile environment, OCR will evaluate whether the school met its obligation under Title VI to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent harassment from recurring. In other words, a school violates Title VI when it fails to take adequate steps to address discriminatory harassment, such as antisemitic harassment.”

        - It seems the oversight for Title VI rests mainly on suggestions and a complaint box.

        - "A broader Title VI inquiry was announced by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in November, investigating universities and K-12 schools for discrimination based on “shared ancestry,” which is harassment based on someone’s ancestry or ethnic characteristics.” 


- Notes on general harassment (not a Title VI violation? but should be part of student training---speech that is disruptive and serves to harass people is no longer protected)

    - 1st Amendment rights are protected based on "time, place, manner" 

    - Speech not following appropriate "time, place, and manner" policies is not protected

        - If certain phrases, mainly, "From the River to the Sea..." are used as a form of harassment, can't they be forced to stop? In other words, it may not be "discrimination" per se, but if its use is sufficiently inappropriate, rules and conduct code against it should apply

            - There is a time and a place for loud chants that can be disruptive to students in class 

                - [TikTok example from 5/24](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNVpURRG/)

            - The big screen that UCLA failed to remove after permit expiration and was disrupting classes 

    

- For training purposes it might be appropriate to say

    - Following time, place and manner is necessary because policies are in place so that everyone can attend their classes and get their education free from disturbance 

    - Anytime time, place and manner is broken, that message, whatever it might be, can become inappropriate and hurt someone
