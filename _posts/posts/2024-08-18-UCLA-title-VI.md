                    - Where did it go? [site](https://equity.ucla.edu/about-us/our-teams/civil-rights-office/discrimination-prevention/)

- Title VI

    - “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title VI states that:

    No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” 70

- “Education and Title VI” page of the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights

    - Vague language wrt monitoring and compliance

    - Displays instead "Dear Colleague" letters as guidance

    - One dated May 25th 2023 covered discrimination based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics

        - “As we witness a nationwide rise in reports of antisemitic harassment, including in schools, I write to remind you of schools’ legal obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including Jewish students, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics."

        - Talks about fact sheet "Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics" 

        - "Schools must take immediate and appropriate action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile environment. OCR generally finds that a hostile environment exists where there is harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school."

        - If a hostile environment based on shared ancestry existed, and the school knew or should have known of the hostile environment, OCR will evaluate whether the school met its obligation under Title VI to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent harassment from recurring. In other words, a school violates Title VI when it fails to take adequate steps to address discriminatory harassment, such as antisemitic harassment.”

        - It seems the oversight for Title VI rests mainly on suggestions and a complaint box.

        - "A broader Title VI inquiry was announced by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in November, investigating universities and K-12 schools for discrimination based on “shared ancestry,” which is harassment based on someone’s ancestry or ethnic characteristics.” 


- Notes on general harassment (not a Title VI violation? but should be part of student training---speech that is disruptive and serves to harass people is no longer protected)

    - 1st Amendment rights are protected based on "time, place, manner" 

    - Speech not following appropriate "time, place, and manner" policies is not protected

        - If certain phrases, mainly, "From the River to the Sea..." are used as a form of harassment, can't they be forced to stop? In other words, it may not be "discrimination" per se, but if its use is sufficiently inappropriate, rules and conduct code against it should apply

            - There is a time and a place for loud chants that can be disruptive to students in class 

                - [TikTok example from 5/24](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNVpURRG/)

            - The big screen that UCLA failed to remove after permit expiration and was disrupting classes 

    

- For training purposes it might be appropriate to say

    - Following time, place and manner is necessary because policies are in place so that everyone can attend their classes and get their education free from disturbance 

    - Anytime time, place and manner is broken, that message, whatever it might be, can become inappropriate and hurt someone 




Tonal negligence as a “perpetrator” of misconduct is everywhere in this problem. “Kohanteb said he feels the university should offer more guidance for students about what constitutes hate speech because he feels some students are ignorant when it comes to antisemitic tropes.“ I’m scared sometimes that hate usually comes from ignorance,” he said. “If we can inform students of what is and what isn’t antisemitic, and where that line is, I think it’d be very beneficial to all.”80 In Student Reactions we observe pervasive and frequent use of the words or phrase, “Intifada”, “Zionist”, and “from the river to the sea…” First off, looking at Figure 71 the DOE’s OCR office has what looks to be somewhat “dated” circumstances that raise Title VI concerns—“A Jewish middle school student feels unsafe at school because classmates routinely place notes with swastikas on the student’s backpack, perform Nazi salutes, and make jokes about the Holocaust.” It is unlikely that a situation like this would arise anymore, because students have found rhetorical “workarounds”, so to speak. This situation also seems quite extreme, if this were the bar to clear I’m not sure the House Committee would need to call a hearing. The OCR should update antisemitic vocabulary and devices for pervasive harassment (this is the age of social media, not written notes). It should also make clear what the minimum requirement is for Title VI infringements.

[CAC message on "Zionist" agitator](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzXnL2ELkpd/?img_index=1)

    - So much wrong with this message. Outside of the "lack of safety from targeting" aspect 

        - The harasser used the word "terrorist"

        - CAC used the word "Zionist" 

            - This word has no definition and is thrown around without a second thought

    - “”I’ve been spit in the face. I’ve been directly pushed. I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,” said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. “I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.””

    - “A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of physical violence perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed.”

    - “Even if it’s nothing political and you just have Arabic writing on your shirt – and it could literally mean sunshine – they will literally call you a terrorist now.”

Office of EDI: "The website suffers from poor information architecture, with related content scattered across multiple links, dropdowns, and pages, leading to a disorganized and confusing user experience." If you find useful information somewhere deep within the website it is nearly impossible to locate that information again should you need it. 

A lot of the pages and one training previously mentioned are now gone. Seems to have undergone reorganization. Still confusing and disorganized. 

Stick with Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, what is mandatory, federally and internally, and what is optional

- Dear colleague letters:

    - November 7, 2023: "It is in this context that I write to remind colleges, universities, and schools that receive federal financial assistance of their legal responsibility under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations (Title VI) to provide all students a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics."

    - March 14, 2024: Not much here

    - May 7th 2024: Lays out some applicable scenarios,

        - Chants

        - Symbology

        - Resistance is justified

        - Obvious discrimination 

        - There's also non-affiliate conduct that applies i.e. "shoving," "terrorist"

    - What is the point of building a case and submitting it to OCR? 

        - Long pending periods for cases

        - Examples of changes they've enforced in the past? 

        - There's no way, even if they were capable of reprimanding the school in a timely manner, they could actually get the school to "change." These protests have not elicited any kind of noticeable change.

        - The answer is training and education, that should be mandatory
