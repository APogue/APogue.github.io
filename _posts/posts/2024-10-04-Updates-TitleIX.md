## Updates to Title IX 

### Background 

- It seems that since 2014, the legislature---SaVE---has changed, but fraternity culture has not 

	- [Frat brothers rape 300% more. One in 5 women is sexually assaulted on campus. Should we ban frats?](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/24/rape-sexual-assault-ban-frats), background, this article is from 2014 and names several schools with rape or rape and drug culture

### 2011 Dear Colleague Letter

- [2011 Dear Colleague Letter](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf)

- Definition of sexual harassment 

- Dear colleague letters are just suggestions

### Title IX prior to 2020 

- No definition of sexual harassment 

- [CFR prior to 2020](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-04-10/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-I/part-106)

### Title IX post 2020 

- Defined sexual harassment 

- [CFR post 2020 and pre 2024 Definitions](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2021-04-10/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-I/part-106)

- Sexual harassment means conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:

	(1) An employee of the recipient conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the recipient on an individual's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;

	(2) Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity; or

	(3) “Sexual assault” as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), “dating violence” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10), “domestic violence” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(8), or “stalking” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30).

### Title IX post 2024

- Redefined sexual harassment 

- [CFR post 2024 Definitions](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/part-106#p-106.2(Sex-based%20harassment))

- Gets more specific still 

- (2) Hostile environment harassment.  Unwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person's ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient's education program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment). Whether a hostile environment has been created is a fact-specific inquiry that includes consideration of the following:

- Post 2020, SH that is not categorized as "assault" requires that the conduct be sufficiently "severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive." AND

- Post 2024, SH had the requirement that it be "subjectively and objectively offensive and so severe or pervasive such that..." OR 

### Santa Clara University Law Suit 

- [Lawsuit story in dorm room 1](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/sexual-assault-abuse/students-suing-santa-clara-university-over-sexual-assault-claims-criticize-title-ix-changes/)

- [Lawsuit story in dorm room 2](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/06/14/students-suing-santa-clara-university-over-sex-assault-cases-join-chorus-of-title-ix-concerns/)

- The incident occurred in 2019, [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/06/politics/education-secretary-betsy-devos-title-ix-regulations/index.html) referred to an "2011 Obama-era Dear Colleague letter" that defined sexual harassment before the 2020 FR. I would assume it is the 2011 Dear Colleague letter that served as the foundation for Campus SaVE. Verify at a later time. Currently I will assume that at this time SCU was functioning under the guidance of this Dear Colleague letter. Within this letter is the statement

	"As explained in OCR’s 2001 Guidance, when a student sexually harasses another student, the
	harassing conduct creates a hostile environment if the conduct is sufficiently serious that it
	interferes with or limits a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s
	program. The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to show a repetitive series of
	incidents to prove a hostile environment, particularly if the harassment is physical. Indeed, a
	single or isolated incident of sexual harassment may create a hostile environment if the
	incident is sufficiently severe. For instance, a single instance of rape is sufficiently severe to
	create a hostile environment.10"

- In the above articles, the SCU student (dorm room incident) had this to say, 

	"This plaintiff stated that she asked for a no-contact order and for accommodations to ensure she had no interaction with her attacker, but that instead, she was the one dropped from a class they shared. She also alleges the male student violated the no-contact order by having a private investigator try to reach her.

	According to the lawsuit, an ensuing Title IX investigation in that case concluded the sex was non-consensual. The suit states that the university’s Sexual and Gender Based Misconduct Board “concluded that there was a preponderance of evidence that (the co-plaintiff) was incapacitated and incapable of giving consent and that (the defendant) knew or should have known this. However, the Board did not find that the incident constituted a sexual harassment violation.”

- The story is vague, but the incident occurred prior to the 2020 rule change 

- Dear Colleague letters serve as guidance (verify), the [SCU policy as of 2015](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/about/documents/) was the following, 

- [2015 SCU SVSH Policy](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/eeo/2015-policy-1.pdf) opted for the narrower "AND"

- Defines sexual harassment as "unwelcome, sexual or gender-based verbal, written, online and/or physical conduct," 

	"Anyone experiencing sexual harassment in any Santa Clara University program is encouraged
	to report it immediately to the University’s EEO and Title IX Coordinator. Sexual harassment
	creates a hostile environment, and may be disciplined when it is:
	● Sufficiently severe, persistent/pervasive and objectively offensive that it,
	● has the effect of unreasonably interfering with, denying or limiting employment
 	opportunities or the ability to participate in or benefit from the university’s educational,
 	social and/or residential program, and is..."

- Defines sexual misconduct as

	"California State law defines various violent and/or non-consensual sexual acts as crimes.
	Additionally, Santa Clara University has defned categories of sexual misconduct, as stated below,
	for which action under this policy may be imposed. Generally speaking, Santa Clara University
	considers Non-Consensual Sexual Intercourse violations to be the most serious, and therefore
	typically imposes the most severe sanctions, including suspension or expulsion for students
	and termination for employees. However, the University reserves the right to impose any level of
	sanction, ranging from a reprimand up to and including suspension or expulsion/termination, for any
	act of sexual misconduct or other gender-based ofenses, including intimate partner or relationship
	(dating and/or domestic) violence, non-consensual sexual contact, sexual exploitation, and stalking
	based on the facts and circumstances of the particular grievance. Acts of sexual misconduct may be
	committed by any person upon any other person, regardless of the sex, gender, sexual orientation
	and/or gender identity of those involved. "

- By the above definition, the perpetrator would have had to rape her multiple times in order for the conduct to qualify as Title IX sexual harassment. Therefor by Title IX, the student was not entitled to supportive accommodations. With respect to the rape itself, the school protected itself by reserving the right to "impose any level of sanction" on sexual misconduct. 

- All of this would have been legal. The articles mention the students speculating that the 2020 FR would make things harder for students, referring to what they saw as a narrower definition of SH and the live hearing and cross examination portions of the law (verify).

- I believe they partook in some form of live hearing and cross examination (verify) and that schools already had a system like this in place (UCLA did, verify). It was a concern that schools that did not have this kind of system might struggle to meet the rule change in time. 

- It looks like the 2020 rule change, although it did have an "AND" definition, it was "OR" with respect to sexual assault. So the rule change would have mandated a minimum standard for SH that would have included the incident. This is reflected in the SVSH policy for [SCU in 2022](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/eeo/2022_Policy.pdf).

- However, it is a question of what these schools were choosing to do to protect its students. Even with respect to the sexual harassment definition in 2020, the UC's stated this, 

	"The [new 2020] regulations define sexual harassment as "unwelcome conduct determined by a
	reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it
	effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or
	activity." The DOE definition is different than California state law and our SVSH Policy,
	which uses a severe or pervasive standard, and imposes a higher standard that may
	be harder to prove. However, sexual harassment that does not meet the DOE definition
	may still be addressed under the SVSH Policy."

- So it is clear that UC was choosing (for how long?) a broader definition of SVSH. That any school may legally do so. With respect to SCU, prior to 2020, they chose a narrower definition than OCR very clearly defined in their Dear Colleague letter. They also chose a definition that is equally narrow to OCR in 2020. 

- There is an issue here---As of the 2020 rule change UC states "California state law and our SVSH Policy, which uses a severe or pervasive standard..."

- SCU 2022 SVSH policy,

	"Hostile Environment (Sexual Harassment)
	• unwelcome conduct18
	• determined by a reasonable person
	• to be so severe, and
	• pervasive, and
	• objectively offensive
	• that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University's education program or activity."

	- This doesn't make sense unless as a private university SCU is only subject to a subset of CA SVSH laws. Because their 2015 policy does refer to CA state law. Yet they have the "AND" definition in the above, meeting the federal standard but not the state? Whatever the case, they had the choice to broaden their definition and they chose not to. 

- [SCU 2024 policy](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/policy/title-ix-policy/), 

	"Hostile environment harassment: Hostile environment harassment is
	unwelcome conduct that, when viewed from both a subjective and objective
	perspective, is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it unreasonably
	interferes with, limits, or effectively denies an individual’s ability to participate
	in or benefit from the University’s educational program or activity; employment
	access, benefits or opportunities; or other University programs or activities."

	- Broad references to CA state law

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




- It is moot because reporting culture is said to be "poor" at SCU

- A story (I did not ask to publish formally and do not plan to) from a current student---one fraternity at SCU has a policy for handling assault internally. Where they ask girls to list assault in an "accountability book" so they can hold brothers accountable themselves, with the worst repercussions being expulsion from the frat; no school or police involvement whatsoever. This was apparently the idea of the new frat president after the previous frat president was expelled from the frat for assault. 

- There are no means for proving this from online sources. I can only quote a website saying "people don't report at SCU"

- They do not have mandatory Title IX training annually. They do not have a Title IX accountability report to indicate efforts at transparency or concern for student safety and well-being 

- They have zero Title IX cases pending with OCR, last 2 resolution letters are from [2017](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09172106-a.pdf) and [2018 (Title II and Title VI/IX)](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09172584-a.pdf)

- Title IX Standard of proof

	- [2024 Federal Register Final Rule, Preponderance vs. clear and convincing evidence](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-2424)

		- [2020 Final Rule](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/06/politics/education-secretary-betsy-devos-title-ix-regulations/index.html) DeVos snuck a higher standard of proof option for schools as long as they use it uniformly in all cases (into [COVID legislation](https://x.com/EdWorkforceDems/status/1258058830463799300))

		- "The Department has decided to retain the standard of proof proposed in the July 2022 NPRM, without any changes..." This means that 2024 FR opted to stay with the standard of proof from DeVos' 2020 FR, but they added an option to apply a different standard to employees

		- All universities have stayed with preponderance standard. "UCLA will continue to use the preponderance of evidence standard for its Title IX investigations as well as for other university offices that conduct investigations, he added." [DB article on the 2020 FR](https://dailybruin.com/2020/08/16/new-title-ix-policies-prompt-calls-on-ucla-to-protect-survivors-of-sexual-violence)

- Title IX Jurisdiction

	- It was updated in 2024, the explanation is [rather complicated](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-797), and CFR [§ 106.11 Application](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/section-106.11) is rather vague. 

	- The main point is this---"A recipient has an obligation to address a sex-based hostile environment under its education program or activity, even when some conduct alleged to be contributing to the hostile environment occurred outside the recipient's education program or activity or outside the United States." If the conduct, regardless of where it took place, affects access to education, then measures can be taken. The recipient's obligation may be vague, for example it need not investigate whether the conduct took place and punitive measures for the conduct if it is not under recipient jurisdiction. It may only need to provide supportive measures in these circumstances. 

	- Student A and B jurisdiction 

	- How does that apply to SCU "Lawsuit story" had it occurred at a frat?

	- [SCU Title IX](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/policy/title-ix-policy/), it looks like this is the only SVSH policy they have. [This](https://www.scu.edu/bulletin/undergraduate/EqualOpportunityNondiscriminationandSexualHarassmentPolicies.html) talks about "on-campus and off-campus conduct," but not specifically. It refers the reader to the Title IX office. The SCU Title IX policy is specific about its jurisdiction, which is limited and does not include the frats. 



- [this](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/training/student/) also refers to both on-campus and off-campus conduct

#### Background

- Greek life is a major part of the social scene at SCU. This means SCU *relies* on the Greek system to attract students. 

- Serious fraternity-related [assault is occurring](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/04/santa-clara-university-students-demand-action-from-school-after-multiple-sexual-assault-allegations/amp/). 

- [Another article 1](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/south-bay/hundreds-rally-at-santa-clara-university-to-condemn-sexual-assault-demand-action/2671711/)

- [Another article 2](https://www.ktvu.com/news/sexual-assaults-go-largely-unreported-santa-clara-university-and-students-talk-disparity-in-numbers),

- The administration took a "my word versus yours" position. They claimed incidents were not happening because reports were not being made. 

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCU/comments/12snkpf/how_bad_is_sexual_assault_at_scu/), 

- [Reddit2](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCU/comments/17yppxz/give_it_to_me_straight_how_is_scu_i_need_the_real/), 

- [Reddit3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCU/comments/el64lo/greek_life_reputation/), 

	- "If you like drinking all day, being a dick, getting hazed, and trying to force girls to fornicate, scu greek life is for you." 

- [Reddit4](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/h9595f/students_suing_santa_clara_university_over_sex/)

- [Reddit5](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/q2apxd/santa_clara_university_students_demand_action/) 

	- "As an alum, the school's failure to handle these situations properly doesn't surprise me at all. I saw several abusers protected during my time at SCU. It's not a place I'd ever send my kids, nor a place I'd donate to."

	- "Too bad the DEA can't do something useful like stop and frisking for roofies instead of raiding dispenseries"

		"Haven’t stop and frisk laws(extremely unconstitutional) only been used to racial profile in the past? There has to be better ways"

		"I don't see any realistic proactive alternatives to crack down on possession of rohypnol and reduce these assaults"

#### SCU and Campus SaVE/Title VI

- SCU dissociated completely from its [fraternity and sorority system](https://dh.scu.edu/exhibits/exhibits/show/greeklifescu), yet still, today, "with six Fraternities and five Sororities, more than twenty-five percent of Santa Clara students are involved in Greek life."

- They want to have their cake and eat it too.

- The dissociation means Greek life at SCU is not under Clery jurisdiction
