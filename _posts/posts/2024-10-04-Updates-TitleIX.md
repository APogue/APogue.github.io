## Updates to Title IX 

### Background 

- It seems that since 2014, the legislature---SaVE---has changed, but fraternity culture has not 

	- [Frat brothers rape 300% more. One in 5 women is sexually assaulted on campus. Should we ban frats?](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/24/rape-sexual-assault-ban-frats), background, this article is from 2014 and names several schools with rape or rape and drug culture

### 2011 Dear Colleague Letter

- [2011 Dear Colleague Letter](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf)

- Definition of sexual harassment 

- Dear colleague letters are just suggestions (verify)

### Title IX prior to 2020 

- No definition of sexual harassment 

- [CFR prior to 2020](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-04-10/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-I/part-106)

### Title IX post 2020 

- Defined sexual harassment 

- [CFR post-2020 and pre-2024 Definitions](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2021-04-10/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-I/part-106)

- Sexual harassment means conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:

	(1) An employee of the recipient conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the recipient on an individual's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;

	(2) Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity; or

	(3) “Sexual assault” as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), “dating violence” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10), “domestic violence” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(8), or “stalking” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30).

### Title IX post 2024

- Redefined sexual harassment 

- [CFR post-2024 Definitions](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/part-106#p-106.2(Sex-based%20harassment))

- Gets more specific still 

- (2) Hostile environment harassment.  Unwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person's ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient's education program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment). Whether a hostile environment has been created is a fact-specific inquiry that includes consideration of the following:

- Post 2020, SH that is not categorized as "assault" requires that the conduct be sufficiently "severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive." AND

- Post 2024, SH had the requirement that it be "subjectively and objectively offensive and so severe or pervasive such that..." OR 

### Santa Clara University Law Suit 

- [Lawsuit story in dorm room 1](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/sexual-assault-abuse/students-suing-santa-clara-university-over-sexual-assault-claims-criticize-title-ix-changes/)

- [Lawsuit story in dorm room 2](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/06/14/students-suing-santa-clara-university-over-sex-assault-cases-join-chorus-of-title-ix-concerns/)

	- How is this not [deliberate indifference?](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-841) (by the 2024 standard)

		- "See 526 U.S. at 646-7 (“We thus conclude that recipients of federal funding may be liable for `subject[ing]' their students to discrimination where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual harassment and the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority.”); Brown, 82 F.4th at 875 (“[A] key consideration is whether the school has some form of disciplinary authority over the harasser in the setting in which the harassment takes place.”);"

- The incident occurred in 2019, [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/06/politics/education-secretary-betsy-devos-title-ix-regulations/index.html) referred to an "2011 Obama-era Dear Colleague letter" that defined sexual harassment before the 2020 FR. 

	"As explained in OCR’s 2001 Guidance, when a student sexually harasses another student, the
	harassing conduct creates a hostile environment if the conduct is sufficiently serious that it
	interferes with or limits a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s
	program. The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to show a repetitive series of
	incidents to prove a hostile environment, particularly if the harassment is physical. Indeed, a
	single or isolated incident of sexual harassment may create a hostile environment if the
	incident is sufficiently severe. For instance, a single instance of rape is sufficiently severe to
	create a hostile environment.10" Pp. 3


	"Title IX requires a school to take steps to protect the complainant as necessary, including taking
	interim steps before the final outcome of the investigation. The school should undertake these
	steps promptly once it has notice of a sexual harassment or violence allegation. The school
	should notify the complainant of his or her options to avoid contact with the alleged
	perpetrator and allow students to change academic or living situations as appropriate. For
	instance, the school may prohibit the alleged perpetrator from having any contact with the
	complainant pending the results of the school’s investigation. 


	When taking steps to separate the complainant and alleged perpetrator, a school should minimize the burden on the complainant, and thus should not, as a matter of course, remove complainants from classes or housing while allowing alleged perpetrators to remain. In addition, schools should ensure that complainants are aware of their Title IX rights and any available resources, such as counseling, health, and mental health services, and their right to file a complaint with local law
	enforcement.41" Pp. 16

- [REVISED SEXUAL HARASSMENT GUIDANCE: HARASSMENT OF STUDENTS BY SCHOOL EMPLOYEES, OTHER STUDENTS, OR THIRD PARTIES, January 2001](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.pdf)

	- "The more severe the conduct, the less the need to show a repetitive series of incidents; this is particularly true if the harassment is physical. For instance, if the conduct is more severe, e.g., attempts to grab a female student’s breasts or attempts to grab any student’s genital area or buttocks, it need not be as persistent to create a hostile environment. Indeed, a single or isolated incident of sexual harassment may, if sufficiently severe, create a hostile environment.4"

- Santa Clara specifically referred to the two above documents in their policy manual, but this definition goes back farther, [Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 213, 2000](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-11-02/pdf/00-27910.pdf)

	- "As the discussion in 62 FR 12041 makes clear, our definition reflects a continuum of severity. The ‘‘or’’ merely indicated that a particularly severe incident may not need to be persistent to be a problem under Title IX"

	- The doc refers to consistency with a 1997 document with the same guidance, so this guidance has been in place for at least 27 years

- [For almost 3 decades, Title IX has effectively been broader than the Davis standard](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-518) "because the Department also believes a broader standard is appropriate to enforce Title IX's prohibition on sex discrimination in the administrative context, in which educational access is the goal and private damages are not at issue."

- In the above articles, the SCU student (dorm room incident) had this to say, 

	"This plaintiff stated that she asked for a no-contact order and for accommodations to ensure she had no interaction with her attacker, but that instead, she was the one dropped from a class they shared. She also alleges the male student violated the no-contact order by having a private investigator try to reach her.

	According to the lawsuit, an ensuing Title IX investigation in that case concluded the sex was non-consensual. The suit states that the university’s Sexual and Gender Based Misconduct Board “concluded that there was a preponderance of evidence that (the co-plaintiff) was incapacitated and incapable of giving consent and that (the defendant) knew or should have known this. However, the Board did not find that the incident constituted a sexual harassment violation.”

- [2015 SCU SVSH Policy](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/eeo/2015-policy-1.pdf) opted for the narrower "AND" (Davis standard)

- Defines sexual harassment as "unwelcome, sexual or gender-based verbal, written, online and/or physical conduct," 

	"Anyone experiencing sexual harassment in any Santa Clara University program is encouraged
	to report it immediately to the University’s EEO and Title IX Coordinator. Sexual harassment
	creates a hostile environment, and may be disciplined when it is:
	● Sufficiently severe, persistent/pervasive and objectively offensive that it,
	● has the effect of unreasonably interfering with, denying or limiting employment
 	opportunities or the ability to participate in or benefit from the university’s educational,
 	social and/or residential program, and is..."

- Defines sexual misconduct as

	"California State law defines various violent and/or non-consensual sexual acts as crimes.
	Additionally, Santa Clara University has defned categories of sexual misconduct, as stated below,
	for which action under this policy may be imposed. Generally speaking, Santa Clara University
	considers Non-Consensual Sexual Intercourse violations to be the most serious, and therefore
	typically imposes the most severe sanctions, including suspension or expulsion for students
	and termination for employees. However, the University reserves the right to impose any level of
	sanction, ranging from a reprimand up to and including suspension or expulsion/termination, for any
	act of sexual misconduct or other gender-based ofenses, including intimate partner or relationship
	(dating and/or domestic) violence, non-consensual sexual contact, sexual exploitation, and stalking
	based on the facts and circumstances of the particular grievance. Acts of sexual misconduct may be
	committed by any person upon any other person, regardless of the sex, gender, sexual orientation
	and/or gender identity of those involved. "

- By the above definition, the perpetrator would have had to rape her multiple times in order for the conduct to qualify as "Title IX sexual harassment." Therefor "by Title IX," the student was not entitled to supportive accommodations. With respect to the rape itself, the school reserved the right to "impose any level of sanction" on sexual misconduct. 

- The 2015 SCU policy refers to the Title IX Coordinator and both above 2011 and 2001 guidance documents, they were clearly aware of the broader definitions; and misleadingly included references to broader protections by referring to the policy.

- All of this would have been legal(?), the [Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 213](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-11-02/pdf/00-27910.pdf) put it well, 

	- "D. OCR Case Resolution---The 1997 guidance discussion of liability contained a subsection titled
''OCR Case Resolution.'' Because the focus of the proposed revised guidance is specifically OCR enforcement, this section has been retained and clarified. This section lets schools know that, even if the school discriminates, the
school does not immediately lose Federal funds on that basis alone. Consistent with the Title IX statute, we provide recipients with the opportunity to take timely and effective corrective action before issuing a formal finding of
violation"

	- What SCU did was a Title IX violation, but the school would not be held accountable unless a complaint were filed with OCR. It is a reactive system. 

	- Good case for notification and preventative measures

- The articles mention the student confusion, speculating that the 2020 FR would make things harder for students, referring to what they saw as a narrower definition of SH and the live hearing and cross examination portions of the law (verify).

- I believe they partook in some form of live hearing and cross examination (verify) and that schools already had a system like this in place (UCLA did, verify). It was a concern that schools that did not have this kind of system might struggle to meet the rule change in time. 

- It looks like the 2020 rule change, although it did have an "AND" definition, it was "OR" with respect to sexual assault. So the rule change would have mandated a minimum standard for SH that would have included the incident. This is reflected in the SVSH policy for [SCU in 2022](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/eeo/2022_Policy.pdf).

- However, it is a question of what these schools were choosing to do to protect its students. Even with respect to the sexual harassment definition in 2020, [the UC's stated this](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/file/ff9b59bd-21ce-48df-8fc1-d5d26eda55bb), 

	"The [new 2020] regulations define sexual harassment as "unwelcome conduct determined by a
	reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it
	effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or
	activity." The DOE definition is different than California state law and our SVSH Policy,
	which uses a severe or pervasive standard, and imposes a higher standard that may
	be harder to prove. However, sexual harassment that does not meet the DOE definition
	may still be addressed under the SVSH Policy."

- So it is clear that UC was choosing (for how long?) a broader definition of SVSH. That any school may legally do so. With respect to SCU, prior to 2020, they chose a narrower definition than OCR very clearly defined in their Dear Colleague letter. They also chose a definition that is equally narrow to OCR in 2020. 

- There is an issue here---As of the 2020 rule change UC states "California state law and our SVSH Policy, which uses a severe or pervasive standard..."

- SCU 2022 SVSH policy,

	"Hostile Environment (Sexual Harassment)
	• unwelcome conduct18
	• determined by a reasonable person
	• to be so severe, and
	• pervasive, and
	• objectively offensive
	• that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University's education program or activity."

	- This doesn't make sense unless as a private university SCU is only subject to a subset of CA SVSH laws. Because their 2015 policy does refer to CA state law. Yet they have the "AND" definition in the above, meeting the federal standard but not the state? Whatever the case, they had the choice to broaden their definition and they chose not to. 

- [SCU 2024 policy](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/policy/title-ix-policy/), 

	"Hostile environment harassment: Hostile environment harassment is
	unwelcome conduct that, when viewed from both a subjective and objective
	perspective, is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it unreasonably
	interferes with, limits, or effectively denies an individual’s ability to participate
	in or benefit from the University’s educational program or activity; employment
	access, benefits or opportunities; or other University programs or activities."

	- Broad references to CA state law

	- They may have a different obligation than the UC and CSU system under CA law

#### Had the incident occurred at a fraternity...

- 2020 CFR is clear and explicit with respect to Title VI jurisdiction

- Post-2020, while there is language in the Title IX law for the inclusion of fraternities and sororities, due to the non-affiliate status of SCU fraternities and sororities, had the incident occurred at a frat, it would have been dismissed. (There's language in the SCU policy that permits broader interpretations, but given this was not the action taken with respect to the case and the previous policy, there's no reason to believe it would apply here.)

- Beginning in 2022, the SCU policy provides a "scope"---"This Policy can also be applied to the effects of off-campus misconduct that effectively deprives or limits the educational or employment access, benefits, and/or opportunities.10" (footnote is very vague)

	- By the SCU 2022 policy standard can the effects of a single assault occurring outside the program or activity be considered hostile environment sexual harassment within their program or activity? No, because it may be sufficiently severe, but not pervasive. 

	- The above was the official SCU policy on SVSH until August of 2024

### The Clery Act

- Santa Clara University Clery responsibility---

	- "A crime is considered “reported” when it is brought to the attention of a CSA, Campus Safety Services or local law enforcement by a victim, witness, other third party, or even the suspect."

		- Had the reports just been made (does not automatically initiate investigation or notify respondent), with respect to the drugging and assault incidents, SCU might have been flagged by the DOE (verify)

	- [Intersection with Title IX](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/university-operations/campus-safety/campus-safety/miscellaneous/FERPA-Chart.pdf)

	- [Clery Geography SCU](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/emergency-planning/Clery-Geography-Map.pdf)

	- "Non Campus property:

		- Any building or property owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the institution; or..."

	- [What the Clery Numbers Do and Do Not Say](https://www.scu.edu/campus-safety/clery-act-compliance/)

		- "Statistics compiled for the annual security report and shared with the Department of Education DO INCLUDE those reported to the “campus security authorities”, such as campus police or security, a coach, an advisor to a student group or a dean of students." (what about mention of Title IX office? verify)

		- "These statistics DO NOT reflect incidents reported that occurred in areas that are not Clery geography (such as at an off-campus party at a location not owned or controlled by the institution, an incident that occurs at a local bar or club, or an incident that occurs in the hometown of a student)."

	- [2024 SCU Clery Report](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/university-operations/campus-safety/campus-safety/annual-clery-pdfs/2024-Annual-Security-&-Fire-Safety-Report---Main-Campus.pdf)

		- "A Timely Warning, also known as a Crime Alert, will be issued for all Clery Act crimes that occur on UCLA’s Clery Act geography that are reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies and are considered by the institution to represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees."

	- [Clery Timely Warning, 10-7](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1fynrh4/this_is_insane/)

### Title IX Jurisdiction

- Obama-era guidance in Dear Colleague letter---

	- "Schools may have an obligation to respond to student-on-student sexual harassment that
	initially occurred off school grounds, outside a school’s education program or activity. If a
	student files a complaint with the school, regardless of where the conduct occurred, the school
	must process the complaint in accordance with its established procedures. Because students
	often experience the continuing effects of off-campus sexual harassment in the educational
	setting, schools should consider the effects of the off-campus conduct when evaluating
	whether there is a hostile environment on campus. For example, if a student alleges that he or
	she was sexually assaulted by another student off school grounds, and that upon returning to
	school he or she was taunted and harassed by other students who are the alleged perpetrator’s
	friends, the school should take the earlier sexual assault into account in determining whether
	there is a sexually hostile environment. The school also should take steps to protect a student
	who was assaulted off campus from further sexual harassment or retaliation from the
	perpetrator and his or her associates." Pp. 4

- Rolled back in 2020 amendments---

	- [§ 106.11 Application.](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2021-04-10/title-34/section-106.11)

		- "Except as provided in this subpart, this part 106 applies to every recipient and to the education program or activity operated by such recipient which receives Federal financial assistance."


	- [§ 106.44 Recipient's response to sexual harassment.](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2021-04-10/title-34/section-106.44)

		- "“education program or activity” includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution. A recipient's response must treat complainants and respondents equitably by offering supportive measures as defined in § 106.30 to a complainant, and by following a grievance process that complies with § 106.45 before the imposition of any disciplinary sanctions or other actions that are not supportive measures as defined in § 106.30, against a respondent."

	- § 106.45 Grievance process for formal complaints of sexual harassment.

		- [(3) Dismissal of a formal complaint---](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2021-04-10/title-34/part-106#p-106.45(b)(3))

			- (i) The recipient must investigate the allegations in a formal complaint. If the conduct alleged in the formal complaint would not constitute sexual harassment as defined in § 106.30 even if proved, did not occur in the recipient's education program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, then the recipient must dismiss the formal complaint with regard to that conduct for purposes of sexual harassment under title IX or this part; such a dismissal does not preclude action under another provision of the recipient's code of conduct.

- Restored in the 2024 amendments---

	- [§ 106.11 Application](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/section-106.11)

		- "Except as provided in this subpart, this part applies to every recipient and to all sex discrimination occurring under a recipient's education program or activity in the United States. For purposes of this section, conduct that occurs under a recipient's education program or activity includes but is not limited to conduct that occurs in a building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution, and conduct that is subject to the recipient's disciplinary authority. A recipient has an obligation to address a sex-based hostile environment under its education program or activity, even when some conduct alleged to be contributing to the hostile environment occurred outside the recipient's education program or activity or outside the United States." 

	- [The explanation](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-797)

- The 2024 amendments are deliberate and vague---err on the side of sanctions only when the respondent is subject to recipient's disciplinary authority or the incident occurred within the education program or activity (given circumstances are not extraordinary). Thus, it is likely that post-2024 amendments, incidents occurring at off-campus locations such as non-affiliate fraternities and sororities, depending on severity, would not be subject to disciplinary sanction. Respondents are entitled to due process, schools may not have the authority or obligation to meet evidentiary standards required for disciplinary sanction if an incident occurred outside of the program or activity, unless absolutely necessary. 


	- "[As discussed in the July 2022 NPRM,](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-797) conduct occurring under a recipient's education program or activity would include, but is not limited to, conduct that occurs in off-campus settings that are operated or overseen by the recipient, including, for example, field trips, online classes, and athletic programs; conduct subject to a recipient's disciplinary authority that occurs off campus; conduct that takes place via school-sponsored electronic devices, computer and internet networks and digital platforms operated by, or used in the operations of, the recipient, including AI technologies; and conduct that occurs during training programs sponsored by a recipient at another location."

	- "The recipient would not, however, have a standalone obligation to address the underlying alleged sexual assault of Student A that allegedly occurred while Student A and Student B were abroad because Title IX's protections do not apply extraterritorially."

	- "When, for example, a student alleges they have been assaulted by a professor in a study abroad program and that a sex-based hostile environment exists when the student and professor return to campus, a recipient would be obligated to address the alleged hostile environment that exists under its education program or activity in the United States. How a recipient should address a complaint of a hostile environment resulting from conduct alleged to have occurred outside of the United States will depend on the particular facts and circumstances."


	- "Further, the Department notes that Federal courts have held that a recipient's responsibilities under Title IX extend to conduct subject to the recipient's disciplinary authority. See, e.g., Brown, 82 F.4th at 878-79 (finding student presented sufficient evidence of substantial control when, among other things, the university's code of conduct applied to conduct “both on-campus and off-campus” and the university previously issued a no-contact order that applied off campus). The Department confirms that if a recipient has disciplinary authority over a teacher's sexual harassment of a student that occurs off campus or outside of a school-sponsored activity, a recipient would be obligated to respond to that sexual harassment under § 106.11."

	- "The Department also appreciates the opportunity to clarify its discussion of buildings owned or controlled by a student organization officially recognized by a postsecondary institution. The decision to officially recognize a student organization is within the purview of the postsecondary institution itself and will depend on that institution's particular policies and procedures."

	- [A recipient](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/part-106/section-106.45#p-106.45(h)(3)) may not impose discipline on a respondent for sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX unless there is a determination at the conclusion of the recipient's grievance procedures that the respondent engaged in prohibited sex discrimination;

	- [When the decisionmaker](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/part-106/section-106.46#p-106.46(h)) finds that sex-based harassment occurred, any disciplinary sanctions the postsecondary institution will impose on the respondent, whether remedies other than the imposition of disciplinary sanctions will be provided by the postsecondary institution to the complainant, and, to the extent appropriate, other students identified by the postsecondary institution to be experiencing the effects of the sex-based harassment; and

- With respect to SCU's handling it is clear, 

	- Individuals who use alcohol and alcohol laced with elicit substances as a weapon to commit rape are not considered a threat to campus security

	- Individuals who commit this form of rape are not considered contributors to hostile environments, and are not considered a threat to campus security 

		- This is because SCU is happy to turn a blind eye to non-affiliate fraternity activities and welcome those who partake to be present on campus day after day

		- This is because through a series of tactics used by the administration to dismiss and deny the student body, and to silence survivors, even acts that might clear the SCU Title IX hostile environment standard, had survivors been supported, were never reported or corroborated with multiple accounts against the same individuals

		- This means practically speaking, given the culture of sexual assault at SCU, there is no evidence to suggest that perpetrators were not free to commit sexual violence multiple times without consequence

- The bar is incredibly high in criminal and civil trials, administrative enforcement of Title IX may be the only recourse students have, and schools have a history of indifference

### SCU and Title IX 

- [Policy](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/policy/), here it is only EO and Title IX policy

- [SCU Policy Archive](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/about/documents/), the documents here are explicit with respect to Title IX, and there are references to school's SVSH policy. I can't find other documents that talk explicitly about their SVSH policy, should it offer broader coverage. Buried within student conduct policy? Looks like these updates are due to updates from the DOE. (How old is Equal Opportunity Policy then?)

- [Student Conduct Code](https://www.scu.edu/academic-integrity/student-resources/student-conduct-code/#d.en.665447) is shockingly short

- [Some other SCU policy manual ](https://www.scu.edu/bulletin/undergraduate/EqualOpportunityNondiscriminationandSexualHarassmentPolicies.html), vague with respect to SVSH

- [SCU student training](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/training/student/) and other related Title IX material 


### SCU promotes a culture of nonreporting 

- Deliberate indifference to and punishment/retaliation of a reporter

- Reddit

- By not investigating plausible claims 

- By the evidence showing that OCR has had no reports submitted and only three irrelevant resolutions since 2013

- By taking the public position if a report was not made then the incident did not actually happen 

- Legally banning fraternities and sororities 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- It is moot because reporting culture is said to be "poor" at SCU

- A story (I did not ask to publish formally and do not plan to) from a current student---one fraternity at SCU has a policy for handling assault internally. Where they ask girls to list assault in an "accountability book" so they can hold brothers accountable themselves, with the worst repercussions being expulsion from the frat; no school or police involvement whatsoever. This was apparently the idea of the new frat president after the previous frat president was expelled from the frat for assault. 

- There are no means for proving this from online sources. I can only quote a website saying "people don't report at SCU"

- They do not have mandatory Title IX training annually. They do not have a Title IX accountability report to indicate efforts at transparency or concern for student safety and well-being 

- They have zero Title IX cases pending with OCR, last 2 resolution letters are from [2017](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09172106-a.pdf) and [2018 (Title II and Title VI/IX)](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09172584-a.pdf)

- Title IX Standard of proof

		- [2020 Final Rule](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/06/politics/education-secretary-betsy-devos-title-ix-regulations/index.html) DeVos snuck a higher standard of proof option for schools as long as they use it uniformly in all cases (into [COVID legislation](https://x.com/EdWorkforceDems/status/1258058830463799300))

		- "The Department has decided to retain the standard of proof proposed in the July 2022 NPRM, without any changes..." This means that 2024 FR opted to stay with the standard of proof from DeVos' 2020 FR, but they added an option to apply a different standard to employees

		- All universities have stayed with preponderance standard. "UCLA will continue to use the preponderance of evidence standard for its Title IX investigations as well as for other university offices that conduct investigations, he added."

#### Background

- Greek life is a major part of the social scene at SCU. This means SCU *relies* on the Greek system to attract students. 

- Serious fraternity-related [assault is occurring](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/04/santa-clara-university-students-demand-action-from-school-after-multiple-sexual-assault-allegations/amp/). 

- [Another article 1](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/south-bay/hundreds-rally-at-santa-clara-university-to-condemn-sexual-assault-demand-action/2671711/)

- [Another article 2](https://www.ktvu.com/news/sexual-assaults-go-largely-unreported-santa-clara-university-and-students-talk-disparity-in-numbers),

- The administration took a "my word versus yours" position. They claimed incidents were not happening because reports were not being made. 

	- The response by the administrator was giving 2002. How often does any administrator function without substantial training and policy experience informing their positions? It felt like a backwards, common sense kind of response. When these gross generalizations are applied, effectively deciding the fate of hundreds or even thousands of students, it's pretty reckless.

	- Where was the constructive notice for DOE, OCR, anyone? How did the DOE not know this was going on, is that not why they have regional offices?

	- "If you like drinking all day, being a dick, getting hazed, and trying to force girls to fornicate, scu greek life is for you."

- [Reddit5](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/q2apxd/santa_clara_university_students_demand_action/) 

	- "As an alum, the school's failure to handle these situations properly doesn't surprise me at all. I saw several abusers protected during my time at SCU. It's not a place I'd ever send my kids, nor a place I'd donate to."

	- "Too bad the DEA can't do something useful like stop and frisking for roofies instead of raiding dispenseries"

		"Haven’t stop and frisk laws(extremely unconstitutional) only been used to racial profile in the past? There has to be better ways"

		"I don't see any realistic proactive alternatives to crack down on possession of rohypnol and reduce these assaults"

#### SCU and Campus SaVE/Title VI

- SCU dissociated completely from its [fraternity and sorority system](https://dh.scu.edu/exhibits/exhibits/show/greeklifescu), yet still, today, "with six Fraternities and five Sororities, more than twenty-five percent of Santa Clara students are involved in Greek life."

- They want to have their cake and eat it too.

- The dissociation means Greek life at SCU is not under Clery jurisdiction
