- "Notes" post will be reorganized and redistributed here and elsewhere

- Go over the other sections and recursively add to this section 


### The case for an overhaul of Title VI in general 

- The goal is to cast doubt, which means make it impossible to disprove the possibility that civil rights violations that equate to denied access to education are occurring 

#### The "institution side" of the loop is broken

- Based on the last year, it is impossible to say that the current standard for Title VI is working, we know that with respect to antisemitic and anti-Muslim activity

- Michigan is an example of the schools themselves not knowing Title VI 

	- Decentralized reporting with little to no accountability

	- Difficulty deciphering between creation of a hostile environment and protected speech

#### The "student side" of the loop is broken

- *Based on these issues why would we assume it is working at all?* 

- The law is vague with respect to what constitutes "protection of rights"

	- It largely relies on the student to protect themselves

	- But the student cannot be relied upon to be *aware and proactive* without, at the very least, notification and literacy

- Thus, there is no way to determine whether low reporting is due to a low number of incidents or a broken system

#### Campus climate is a related problem

- If the law is vague, and left up to the recipient---who may themselves be the subject of reports---to define "access to education," then that access may be vulnerable

- What are the diversity enrollments in STEM?

- If we don't know, how can we say there's no correlation between minority enrollment and a negative STEM "climate?"

### Notes 

- [Accountability report 2020](https://accountability.universityofcalifornia.edu/2020/chapters/chapter-7.html#7.3.1)

	- "African American students are less likely to feel that students of their race/ethnicity are respected on their campus than other students."

	- Other valuable info here such see other charts

- [UCOP Academic Affairs](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-affairs/prop-209/index.html#:~:text=Proposition%20209%2C%20passed%20in%201996,public%20contracting%20and%20public%20education.) research and analyses on the impact of proposition 209 in CA 


- Training should include

	- message activism over identity activism


- There's anxiety about possible outcomes 

	- The goal should be to encourage people, if nothing else, to just submit a report 

		- It should be clear to students first and foremost that an arrest does not have to be made and a Title IX investigation does not need to be initiated

		- Beyond this step, they should trust that the grievance process is discrete and fair 



- Why is there a stigma in talking about SVSH? Why don't we know how pervasive SVSH is? Why aren't students surveyed? 

	- How can anyone have any idea if the number of reports is anywhere close to the number of incidents? Is this not a concern for the well-being of the students? 



- More money for DOE and OCR 





- For *both* Title IX and Title VI, *in the training*, they need to be *promoting a culture of reporting and safety*



- Students are adults, and should be treated as such. An equitable environment shouldn't mean punishment.


- Problems with UCUES

	- UCUES is optional 

	- UCUES is massive 

	- UCUES made certain civil rights questions optional, in an optional survey 




- UCLA annual data report has inexplicable discrepancies 

	- Civil rights reporting is low compared to Title IX
