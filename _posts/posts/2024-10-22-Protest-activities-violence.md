Thesis1: When a serious incident occurred in October, the university did not find it merited a response. 

Thesis2: This incident does show, however, that when students seek to further the academic mission of the university, the university will show them no protection. 

Thesis3: There have been many instances of harassment of pro-Palestinian students on campus while the administration turned a blind eye

### Counter-protesters---the tale of the phantom militia 

- The administration will not acknowledge the non-affiliate community in its messaging

	- The students were furthering "the mission of the university" 

	- [Hillel condemned it](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyT4RrxPNJU/?img_index=2) 

	- Non-affiliates clearly broke the law, UCLA conduct policy and UCLA non-affiliate conduct policy, should have been

		- Arrested for intimidation, property damage, attempted assault characterized by bias 

		- Cited for harassment and disruption of university operations

		- No-contact order 

		- They were permitted to leave the premises 

- Block [statement Oct 13th](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/reflections-at-the-close-of-a-difficult-week/)

	- "Only six days ago, a heinous assault was perpetrated upon Israeli civilians by the terror organization Hamas, a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly as well as the taking of innocent hostages. Earlier this week, I joined UC leadership in condemning this attack, and as new details have emerged, I can only denounce it further: This was a grievous act of malice and hate. It was, I am pained to say, the largest one-day killing of Jews since the end of the Holocaust.

		Since then, Israel has responded to the assault, leading to a significant loss of Palestinian lives and the troubling displacement of large numbers of innocent individuals."

	- "This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. We must not devolve into violating one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911."

		- Harassment based on a "perceived Protected Category?" 

		- This statement is an admission of knowledge. This statement is requiring "actual notice," a higher standard than currently exists (DeVos messed with this standard in the Title IX rollback). This statement looks like willful indifference. 

		- “To establish a violation of Title VI under the hostile environment theory, OCR must find that: (1) a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin existed; (2) the recipient had actual or constructive notice of the hostile environment; and (3) the recipient failed to take prompt and effective action to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent the harassment from recurring.” (from UMich Resolution Letter doc)

	- Backlash from some students

		- "“The Palestinian student said they were disappointed that an Oct. 13 statement by the chancellor described the Oct. 7 attack as a “grievous act of malice and hate” against Israelis but Palestinian deaths as “loss of life,” as the tonal shift emphasizes the violence against Israelis over Palestinians. 

			They added that they feel the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than Palestinian students.”" [Nov 19th article](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/students-voice-worries-over-islamophobia-on-ucla-campus)

	- Backlash from SJP, [Oct 16th](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyevGH1p3fw/?hl=en&img_index=3)

		- Can be considered a [political](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/10/8/there-is-nothing-surprising-about-hamass-operation) statement equivalent to the [Israeli position that Palestinian civilians deaths are necessary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/12/hamas-death-toll-gaza-sinwar-messages/) to eradicate Hamas ([source 2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/21/gaza-hospitals-attacks-bombed-israel-war/))

		- By "[constellation of circumstances](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-11-02/pdf/00-27910.pdf)" 

			"Under Davis, determining whether harassment is actionable ‘‘depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships’’"

	- Assault, intimidation

	- Police did not intervene or told them to leave

- Oct 27th, [Hundreds of UCLA students participate in march, walkout for Palestine](https://dailybruin.com/2023/10/26/hundreds-of-ucla-students-participate-in-march-walkout-for-palestine)

	- "Several speakers brought attention to recent allegations of attacks against pro-Palestinian students on campus.

		In the statement, the UCLA spokesperson said members of the student affairs team intervened in response to students at Kaplan Hall allegedly experiencing harassment while attempting to watch a teach-in on their computers. The spokesperson added that the university is still investigating the incident with an eye to holding individuals in violation of university rules and the law accountable.

		“While we don’t believe the individuals who caused the incident are students or affiliated with our campus, we strongly encourage all community members to engage in thoughtful debate and treat everyone with respect,” they said in the statement."

- [Nov 7th incident](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzXnL2ELkpd/?img_index=1)

	- "After a protest held in support of Israel on Nov. 7, the Undergraduate Students Association Council’s Cultural Affairs Commission – which has previously expressed support for Palestine and condemned the United States’ and UC’s financial and military support of Israel – alleged in an Instagram post that protesters harassed, threatened and assaulted students who showed support for Palestine on the same day as the rally." (DB: UCLA faces scrutiny...link below)

	- "Just today, students were selling Kuffiyas on campus on Bruinwalk when older non-students started shoving them. Throughout the day, non-students harassed, threatened, and assaulted BIPOC students, and nothing was done by campus security teams---including UCPD. More than ever, it is clear that there is no safety for...students supporting Palestine on campus. UCLA has still not released even a statement to acknowledge, let alone condemn the hate crimes, harassment, and violence students have faced for years. 

		We call on UCLA, the UC, and other entities of this institution to protect students from the violence that is waged by both students and non-students on you own campuses. We call on campus resources to be more accessible to students facing imminent and indirect danger from Islamophobic, Zionist, and anti-Palestinian violence."

- The Nov 8th incident warranted [condemnation by Block and Drake](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) on Nov 10th, although the previous incident was not explicitly condemned. 

	- "Today, I joined University of California President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors in issuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses — including UCLA — over the past several weeks. We must be crystal clear: discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding."

		 "At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable."


- [Students voice worries over Islamophobia on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/students-voice-worries-over-islamophobia-on-ucla-campus), Nov. 19, 2023 

	- "“‘I’ve been spit in the face. I’ve been directly pushed. I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,’ said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. ‘I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.’”"

		"Mohammad said he feels the university should be doing more to protect students and hold perpetrators of harassment accountable. He added that he feels the university has taken alleged incidents of Islamophobia less seriously than ones of antisemitism.

		“We’re (UCLA is) allowing actual harassment, actual violence, actual verbal and physical assault,” he said. “The double standard is so hard to ignore.”"

	- "“A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of physical violence perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed.”"

		"“When I do go to protest, and I wear my keffiyeh or anything Palestinian, I’m definitely unsafe because seeing firsthand, people get very aggressive and violent when you’re not even trying to interact with them in the slightest,” they said."

	- "Other students also said they had heard of those wearing keffiyehs being harassed. Afnan Khawaja, a fourth-year computer science student and a member of the Muslim Students Association, said he has heard of many instances of harassment, such as one instance when a girl wearing a keffiyeh was pepper-sprayed in Westwood.

		He said he was called a terrorist when he attempted to tell people to stop harassing girls protesting in support of Palestine."


- [UCLA faces scrutiny for safety issues at protests for Israel, Palestine](https://dailybruin.com/2023/12/05/ucla-faces-scrutiny-for-safety-issues-at-protests-for-israel-palestine), Dec 5th, 2023

	- "Mohammad said he thought members of university security who were present at a teach-in about Palestine failed to protect the safety of students. In an Instagram post, SJP at UCLA alleged that  individuals at the event shouted death threats at students attending the teach-in and threw their laptops in the trash."

	-  UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez: 

	- "Mohammad added that he felt UCPD has also targeted protestors supporting Palestine in some instances.

		“The police are always accelerating and agitating the aggression in exchanges with people who are pro-Palestinian and people who are demonstrating for the sake of Palestine,” he said.

		Vazquez said in the statement that administration approaches to policing are decided on a content-neutral basis. 

		He added that the university is increasing safety precautions, such as through additional patrols by UCPD, to protect students on campus, following recent concerns of antisemitism and Islamophobia."

	- "“At on-campus events, UCPD and Student Affairs Monitors — who are trained on de-escalation techniques, and who understand campus policies and operations — are present to defuse possible tensions while protecting participants’ right to speak,” he said in the statement."

		









### Protest 

- Hate speech at the protest 

	- hate speech coming from counter-protesters

		- "A counter-protester smashed the finger of a protester inside using a wooden slab at around 12:28 a.m. Counter-protesters also shouted an anti-Black racial slur at around the same time."
