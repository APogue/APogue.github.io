Thesis: UCLA wants free speech at any cost i.e. safety, equality, and freedom of speech. UCLA is cannabalizing its own mission. UCLA can protect free speech on its campus, but it will require it to be more than "a bank that holds classes."

Thesis: Safety is accountability



### Unprotected free speech

	- The students were furthering "the mission of the university" because they were on the frontier of theoretical knowledge 

	- [Hillel condemned it](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyT4RrxPNJU/?img_index=2) 

	- Non-affiliates clearly broke the law, UCLA conduct policy and UCLA non-affiliate conduct policy, should have been

		- Arrested for intimidation, property damage, attempted assault characterized by bias

	- [Nov 7th incident](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzXnL2ELkpd/?img_index=1)

		- "Just today, students were selling Kuffiyas on campus on Bruinwalk when older non-students started shoving them. Throughout the day, non-students harassed, threatened, and assaulted BIPOC students, and nothing was done by campus security teams---including UCPD. More than ever, it is clear that there is no safety for...students supporting Palestine on campus. UCLA has still not released even a statement to acknowledge, let alone condemn the hate crimes, harassment, and violence students have faced for years. 

			We call on UCLA, the UC, and other entities of this institution to protect students from the violence that is waged by both students and non-students on you own campuses. We call on campus resources to be more accessible to students facing imminent and indirect danger from Islamophobic, Zionist, and anti-Palestinian violence."

	- Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

		- [Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"

	- Warranted [condemnation by Block and Drake](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) on Nov 10th, although the previous incident was not explicitly condemned. 

		- " At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable."

### Quotes 


- [Students voice worries over Islamophobia on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/students-voice-worries-over-islamophobia-on-ucla-campus)

	- "“‘I’ve been spit in the face. I’ve been directly pushed. I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,’ said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. ‘I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.’”"

	- "“A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of physical violence perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed.”"
