Thesis4: It would appear as though, administratively, oversight and involvement are in circumstances where protest activities interfere with UCLA's public image. Rather than legal conditions, it would appear as though these are the conditions under which UCLA gets involved. 

Thesis1: When a serious incident occurred in October, the university did not find it merited a response. 

Thesis2: This incident does show, however, that when students seek to further the academic mission of the university, the university will show them no protection. If these students were African American and their assailants were White, the gravity of the situation might be clearer. 

Thesis3: As a singular major incident occurring after Oct 7th, no pattern indicating bias has appeared yet---as of this time, incidents that were condemned also garnered significant media attention (a question in and of itself). 


### Counter-protesters---the tale of the phantom militia 

- The administration will not acknowledge the non-affiliate community in its messaging 

- Includes protections for instances of shocking messaging or hate speech

	- Block [statement Oct 13th](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/reflections-at-the-close-of-a-difficult-week/)

		- "Only six days ago, a heinous assault was perpetrated upon Israeli civilians by the terror organization Hamas, a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly as well as the taking of innocent hostages. Earlier this week, I joined UC leadership in condemning this attack, and as new details have emerged, I can only denounce it further: This was a grievous act of malice and hate. It was, I am pained to say, the largest one-day killing of Jews since the end of the Holocaust.

			Since then, Israel has responded to the assault, leading to a significant loss of Palestinian lives and the troubling displacement of large numbers of innocent individuals."

		- "This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. We must not devolve into violating one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911."

	- Backlash from some students

		- "“The Palestinian student said they were disappointed that an Oct. 13 statement by the chancellor described the Oct. 7 attack as a “grievous act of malice and hate” against Israelis but Palestinian deaths as “loss of life,” as the tonal shift emphasizes the violence against Israelis over Palestinians. They added that they feel the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than Palestinian students.”" [Nov 19th article](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/students-voice-worries-over-islamophobia-on-ucla-campus)

		- Can be considered a [political](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/10/8/there-is-nothing-surprising-about-hamass-operation) statement equivalent to the [Israeli position that Palestinian civilians deaths are necessary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/12/hamas-death-toll-gaza-sinwar-messages/) to eradicate Hamas ([source 2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/21/gaza-hospitals-attacks-bombed-israel-war/))

### Unprotected free speech

	- The students were furthering "the mission of the university" because they were on the frontier of theoretical knowledge 

	- [Hillel condemned it](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyT4RrxPNJU/?img_index=2) 

	- Non-affiliates clearly broke the law, UCLA conduct policy and UCLA non-affiliate conduct policy, should have been

		- Arrested for intimidation, property damage, attempted assault characterized by bias 

		- Cited for harassment and disruption of university operations

		- No-contact order 

	- They were permitted to leave the premises 

	- Condemnation (or lack thereof)

		- By staff at an event

- Nov 7th and 8th incidents

	- [Nov 7th incident](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzXnL2ELkpd/?img_index=1)

		- "Just today, students were selling Kuffiyas on campus on Bruinwalk when older non-students started shoving them. Throughout the day, non-students harassed, threatened, and assaulted BIPOC students, and nothing was done by campus security teams---including UCPD. More than ever, it is clear that there is no safety for...students supporting Palestine on campus. UCLA has still not released even a statement to acknowledge, let alone condemn the hate crimes, harassment, and violence students have faced for years. 

			We call on UCLA, the UC, and other entities of this institution to protect students from the violence that is waged by both students and non-students on you own campuses. We call on campus resources to be more accessible to students facing imminent and indirect danger from Islamophobic, Zionist, and anti-Palestinian violence."

	

### Quotes 


- [Students voice worries over Islamophobia on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/students-voice-worries-over-islamophobia-on-ucla-campus)

	- "“‘I’ve been spit in the face. I’ve been directly pushed. I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,’ said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. ‘I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.’”"

	- "“A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of physical violence perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed.”"



		








### Protest 

- Hate speech at the protest 

	- hate speech coming from counter-protesters

		- "A counter-protester smashed the finger of a protester inside using a wooden slab at around 12:28 a.m. Counter-protesters also shouted an anti-Black racial slur at around the same time." [Pro-Israel counter-protesters attempt to storm encampment, sparking violence](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/01/pro-israel-counter-protesters-attempt-to-storm-encampment-sparking-violence)

	- hate speech coming from protesters

	- reddit, daily bruin, tiktok

- Students started blockading pathways and excluding students

	- insta, tiktok 

- Then UCLA stepped in (this is the tie in with "UCLA handling doc")

	- No condemnation of hate speech 

	- Allows the sides to become embroiled in conflict 



### Quotes 

- “Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by 	the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and 			Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. ‘I feel very uncomfortable,’ he said. ‘I might skip my 		classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on 			campus.’” [Student onlookers express differing opinions on pro-Palestine encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment)


- [Unmasking counterprotesters who attacked UCLA’s pro-Palestine encampment](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html)

	- "‘You guys are about to get f—ed up’
	In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment."
