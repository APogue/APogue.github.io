Turn into a reference doc: Dear Colleague letters, Title VI definition, applicable quotes, UCLA links, relevant opinions, 1st Amendment protection clarification wrt to protests, etc. 


## Background and context




- Title VI

    - “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title VI states that:

    No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” 



- “Education and Title VI” page of the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights

    - Displays "Dear Colleague" letters as guidance

    - One dated May 25th 2023 covered discrimination based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics

        - “As we witness a nationwide rise in reports of antisemitic harassment, including in schools, I write to remind you of schools’ legal obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including Jewish students, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics."

        - Talks about fact sheet "Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics" 

        - "Schools must take immediate and appropriate action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile environment. OCR generally finds that a hostile environment exists where there is harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school."

        - If a hostile environment based on shared ancestry existed, and the school knew or should have known of the hostile environment, OCR will evaluate whether the school met its obligation under Title VI to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent harassment from recurring. In other words, a school violates Title VI when it fails to take adequate steps to address discriminatory harassment, such as antisemitic harassment.”

        - "A broader Title VI inquiry was announced by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in November, investigating universities and K-12 schools for discrimination based on “shared ancestry,” which is harassment based on someone’s ancestry or ethnic characteristics.” 




- Notes on general harassment (not a Title VI violation? but should be part of student training---speech that is disruptive and serves to harass people is no longer protected)

    - 1st Amendment rights are protected based on "time, place, manner" 

    - Speech not following appropriate "time, place, and manner" policies is not protected

        - If certain phrases, mainly, "From the River to the Sea..." are used as a form of harassment, can't they be forced to stop? In other words, it may not be "discrimination" per se, but if its use is sufficiently inappropriate, rules and conduct code against it should apply

            - There is a time and a place for loud chants that can be disruptive to students in class 

                - [TikTok example from 5/24](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNVpURRG/)

            - The big screen that UCLA failed to remove after permit expiration and was disrupting classes 

                - [Conduct that is not protected under the First Amendment](https://www.thefire.org/news/heres-what-students-need-know-about-protesting-campus-right-now)

    - Otherwise based on "totality of circumstances" this language is possibly "actionable"


- For training purposes it might be appropriate to say

    - Following time, place and manner is necessary because policies are in place so that everyone can attend their classes and get their education free from disturbance 

    - Anytime time, place and manner is broken, that message, whatever it might be, can become inappropriate and hurt someone 


- Even protected speech can be "explained away" if UCLA acts as a "guide." When they "stay out of it," protected speech that is derogatory, or controversial can confuse students who may mistake it for hate speech. 

    - “Kohanteb said he feels the university should offer more guidance for students about what constitutes hate speech because he feels some students are ignorant when it comes to antisemitic tropes.“ I’m scared sometimes that hate usually comes from ignorance,” he said. “If we can inform students of what is and what isn’t antisemitic, and where that line is, I think it’d be very beneficial to all.”80

    - “”I’ve been spit in the face. I’ve been directly pushed. I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,” said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. “I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.””

    - “A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of physical violence perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed.”

    - “Even if it’s nothing political and you just have Arabic writing on your shirt – and it could literally mean sunshine – they will literally call you a terrorist now.”

- Dear colleague letters:

    - November 7, 2023: "It is in this context that I write to remind colleges, universities, and schools that receive federal financial assistance of their legal responsibility under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations (Title VI) to provide all students a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics."

    - March 14, 2024: Not much here

    - May 7th 2024: Lays out some applicable scenarios,

        - Chants

        - Symbology

        - Resistance is justified

        - Obvious discrimination 

        - There's also non-affiliate conduct that applies i.e. "shoving," "terrorist"

    - What is the point of building a case and submitting it to OCR? 

        - Long pending periods for cases

        - Examples of changes they've enforced in the past? 

        - There's no way, even if they were capable of reprimanding the school in a timely manner, they could actually get the school to "change." These protests have not elicited any kind of noticeable change.

        - The answer is training and education, that should be mandatory

## UCLA discrimination infrastructure

Gene Block promised changes but none has been implemented

EDI runs Title IX office and OCR (DPO is not online, operative word, "prevention")

EDI outlines the conduct chart, that relies on administrative holds to function

All OCR relies heavily on complaint filing with no real education infrastructure

Title IX is different because it is mandatory 

Data and reporting, is it more complete wrt Title IX?

The office uses a misnomer to link to "civil rights training" or something, it is Title IX training

Orientation still has the Title VI and "anti-discrimination" training, and freshman orientation is optional 

The SAIROS social media study is dated


## DOE discrimination infrastructure

Pending cases date back to 2014

There should be more transparency at least with respect to progress

Largely functions as a complaint box wrt Title VI 

What kind of funding are they getting?

Thresholds need to be reevaluated 

Dear colleague letters are mere suggestions 


## The accountability feedback loop 

Survey the students

Educate the students 

Monitor complaints 

Report survey feedback and ongoing changes to address issues 


## The greater discrimination problem

History wrt Title IX 

Efforts to address discrimination across the board would help campus culture 


## The future of civil rights accountability 

Who is looking to effectively defund them? 

The need-based issues should be funded first

- [OCR FAQ link Title IX](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/sex.html)

    - When do pervasive, derogatory opinions become "actionable speech or conduct"

        - How do educational institutions balance their Title IX obligations with individuals’ First Amendment rights?
OCR has consistently reaffirmed that the Federal civil rights laws it enforces protect students from prohibited discrimination, including unlawful harassment, and are not intended to restrict expressive activities or speech protected under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.

            Schools can protect students from verbal harassment without running afoul of students’ and staff First Amendment rights. For instance, in a situation where the First Amendment prohibits a public university from restricting the rights of students to express persistent and pervasive derogatory opinions about a particular sex, the university can instead meet its obligation by, among other steps, communicating a rejection of stereotypical, derogatory opinions and ensuring that competing views are heard. Similarly, educational institutions can establish a campus culture that is welcoming and respectful of the diversity of all students and institute campus climate checks to assess the effectiveness of the school’s efforts to ensure that it is free from harassment. Schools can also encourage students on all sides of an issue to express disagreement over ideas or beliefs in a respectful manner. Schools should be alert to take more targeted responsive action when speech crosses over into direct threats or actionable speech or conduct. For additional information on OCR’s policies and the First Amendment, click here.



- [UCLA Title IX Office](https://equity.ucla.edu/education/mandatory-trainings/t9-sexual-violence-sexual-harassment-training/)

    - "The Title IX Office ensures compliance with Title IX Federal law. A component of the law requires Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment training for all community members. The Title IX Office offers training to the UCLA community on conduct prohibited by Title IX and the UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment policy."

    - Can't find explicitly that "training" is required for students, but the policies below may equate to "training"

    - [Prevention training](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/202107-qa-titleix.pdf) (Q3) for students may not actually be required. UCLA may be misinforming with respect to "sexual violence and sexual harassment" training being a Title IX requirement

        - [Campus SaVE Act](http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/titleix/understanding_saveact.php#:~:text=The%20Campus%20Sexual%20Violence%20Elimination,campus%2Dwide%20prevention%20education%20programs.)

        - This explains why many rights covered by Title IX, like protections against gender discrimination, *are not part of the "Title IX" training we receive* 

        - This is extremely confusing because it is called "Title IX Training," but Title IX only encourages training, what specifically motivates the label given? What specifically is mandated by Title IX wrt having rights be known and the communication of policies? 

            - Is it enough to have student policies posted on a website to read? Don't think it is, I would like to find the portion of the law that communicates this because for some reason, it is enough to have all other policies "made available" but not necessarily "made known" to students. 

            - The goal is to align Title VI (and gender + LGBTQ+ discrimination) with Title IX

                - Rights are communicated and students made literate/competent with respect to these rights

                - Prevention education 


- [U.S. Department of Education’s 2024 Title IX Final Rule Overview](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-final-rule-factsheet.pdf)
    
    - Ensure that schools communicate their nondiscrimination policies and procedures.
    The final regulations require schools to clearly and effectively inform key people, including
    students, employees, and applicants, of their nondiscrimination policies and procedures. 

- [OCR know your rights](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-rights-201104.html)

    - Rescinded but the below should still be applicable


    - Every School Must Have And Distribute A Policy Against Sex Discrimination

        - Title IX requires that each school publish a policy that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its education programs and activities.  This notice must be widely distributed and available on an on-going basis.
        The policy must state that inquiries concerning Title IX may be referred to the school’s Title IX coordinator or to OCR.

    - Every School Must Have A Title IX Coordinator

        - Every school must designate at least one employee who is responsible for coordinating the school’s compliance with Title IX.  This person is sometimes referred to as the Title IX coordinator.  Schools must notify all students and employees of the name or title and contact information of the Title IX coordinator.
        The coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing all complaints of sex discrimination and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.


    - Every School Must Have And Make Known Procedures For Students To File Complaints Of Sex Discrimination.

        - Title IX requires schools to adopt and publish grievance procedures for students to file complaints of sex discrimination, including complaints of sexual harassment or sexual violence.  Schools can use general disciplinary procedures to address complaints of sex discrimination.  But all procedures must provide for prompt and equitable resolution of sex discrimination complaints.


- [Brief Overview of Key Provisions of the DOE's 2024 Title IX Final Rule](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-final-rule-summary.pdf)

    - "Clarifies requirements for designating a Title IX Coordinator, adopting and publishing nondiscrimination policies and
grievance procedures, and providing a notice of nondiscrimination. (§ 106.8(a)–(c)). Clarifies which individuals a
recipient must train on Title IX and provides requirements for such training, which vary based on an individual’s role.
(§ 106.8(d)). Requires a recipient to protect the rights of parties who are students with disabilities. (§ 106.8(e)).
Clarifies which records a recipient must maintain for at least seven years. (§ 106.8(f))."

- [Title IX Final Rule (unofficial)](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-unofficial-final-rule-2024.pdf)

    - Administrative requirements are on pg 250

    - Training requirements are on pg 267

        - "Background: Section 106.8(d)(1) requires all employees to be trained on the recipient’s
    obligation to address sex discrimination in its education program or activity, the scope of
    conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including the definition of “sex-based
    harassment,” and all applicable notification and information requirements under §§ 106.40(b)(2)
    and 106.44.""

        - Refers to commenters' arguments against training and lists reasons it supports mandatory training. Among these reasons are additional training shouldn't present significant add-ons with respect to resources for preexisting training infrastructure. 

        - This is a good reason to have a Title VI add-on to Title IX infrastructure 

### Notes

- It looks like with Title IX, based on legal obligations to inform students of their rights, a literacy component is provided. With respect to Title VI, is there a legal obligation to inform students of their rights? Or is there only a legal obligation to "protect" students' rights? If part of that protection mechanism relies on the student then, like Title IX, they should be made literate and informed of their rights. 

- The resolution agreements are mandating annual nondiscrimination training. Looks like they'll require this of every institution that has an issue. 

    - Why this isn't perfect

        - These are reactive measures not proactive measures

        - "Systemic Change: Laws and additional regulations provide a foundation for systemic change, ensuring that all institutions uphold certain standards. This helps create a more consistent and equitable environment across all campuses."

        - The institutions themselves determine "how much to care"

        - The institutions themselves are responsible for determining the extent to which they will hold themselves accountable
