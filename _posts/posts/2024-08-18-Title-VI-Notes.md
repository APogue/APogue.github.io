### Chat GPT says 


- Yes, a factual dispute occurs when the parties disagree on what actually happened. In the context of someone breaking the law, it might mean one party claims an event or action occurred (e.g., a law was broken), and the other party denies it or offers a different version of events.

    For example:

    In a criminal case, a factual dispute could be whether the defendant committed the crime as charged.
    In a civil case, it could involve disagreements over whether one party breached a contract or caused harm.
    Juries are often used in these situations to determine which version of the facts they believe based on the evidence presented.


- A legal dispute occurs when the disagreement is over the interpretation or application of the law, rather than the facts. In this case, both parties may agree on the basic facts but disagree on how the law applies to those facts or what legal principles should govern the outcome.

    For example:

    In a civil case, the parties might agree on what happened (the facts), but disagree on whether those facts constitute a breach of contract under the law.
    In a constitutional case, the issue might be whether a law or government action violates constitutional rights, even if the facts are not in dispute.
    In these situations, the judge typically resolves the dispute by interpreting the law and applying it to the facts.


- Yes, that makes sense. When Title IX is amended, it functions as an "update" by modifying or adding provisions to improve how the law is enforced or interpreted. These amendments can introduce new regulatory measures, clarify existing rules, or expand protections to ensure Title IX is applied more effectively. For instance, changes may address how educational institutions handle issues like discrimination, sexual harassment, or gender equality, thereby refining the enforcement framework.

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs receiving federal funding, hasn't undergone the same series of amendments as Title IX for a few reasons:

    1. Focus of Enforcement: Title IX deals with gender equality and sexual misconduct in educational institutions, issues that have gained substantial attention in recent decades. High-profile cases and societal movements (e.g., #MeToo) have driven demand for clearer and more frequent updates to regulations. Title VI, while critically important, hasn't faced the same concentrated public pressure for revisions in its specific enforcement mechanisms.

    2. Regulatory Approach: Title VI has historically been enforced through federal agency guidance and executive orders rather than frequent statutory amendments or regulatory changes. Federal agencies (like the Department of Education) often interpret and enforce Title VI based on existing guidelines, which gives flexibility in applying it to different contexts without changing the law itself.

    3. Less Legislative Activity: The legal and political landscape for racial and national origin discrimination hasn’t resulted in as many statutory or regulatory updates to Title VI. Unlike Title IX, which has seen calls for change due to specific educational contexts (e.g., sexual harassment, athletics), Title VI has been broadly interpreted through judicial rulings and hasn’t faced the same pressure for regulatory overhaul.

    4. Judicial Influence: Many key Title VI issues, such as affirmative action, have been shaped by court decisions rather than legislative amendments or new regulatory measures. The courts have been the primary venue for significant developments in Title VI enforcement.

    In short, Title VI’s enforcement and interpretation have evolved more through case law and agency guidance, while Title IX has seen more direct amendments and regulatory updates. This may also reflect the different societal and political pressures around gender versus race/national origin discrimination in recent years.

- A statutory update refers to a formal change or amendment made to a law (statute) by a legislative body, such as Congress in the U.S. These updates modify, clarify, or expand the original law’s provisions to address new issues, correct oversights, or improve its effectiveness. Statutory updates can take various forms, including adding new sections, changing existing language, or repealing outdated provisions.

    For example, if Congress amends Title IX to strengthen enforcement mechanisms for handling sexual harassment cases, that would be a statutory update. Similarly, if a new law is passed that adds protections to Title VI, that would also be considered a statutory update.

- Regulatory updates are decided and implemented by federal agencies, not by Congress. These agencies have the authority to interpret and enforce laws passed by Congress, and they create regulations to provide detailed guidelines on how those laws should be applied in practice.

    For example:

    - The Department of Education might issue regulatory updates to clarify how Title IX or Title VI should be enforced in schools.
    
    - These updates are made through a process known as rulemaking, where the agency drafts, proposes, and finalizes new regulations or changes to existing ones.
    
    - The process usually includes a public comment period, allowing stakeholders to provide input before the rules are finalized.
    While statutory updates involve changing the law itself, regulatory updates involve refining how existing laws are implemented and enforced through specific rules and procedures.

- A "Final Rule" refers to a regulation or policy update issued by a federal agency after going through the rulemaking process. It represents the official, final version of the regulatory update that will be enforced.

    Here’s the typical process:

    1. Proposed Rule: The agency first publishes a draft (proposed rule) for public review and comment.
    
    2. Public Comment Period: Stakeholders, including individuals, organizations, and institutions, can submit feedback on the proposed rule.
    
    3. Final Rule: After considering the comments, the agency may revise the proposal before issuing the Final Rule, which becomes legally binding.
    In the context of Title IX, for example, the "Final Rule" would contain detailed regulations that schools and institutions must follow to comply with the law.

- Yes, one significant reason why federal agencies like the Department of Education aren't more proactive in making regulatory updates without public pressure is that these changes often face pushback from institutions and other stakeholders. Here are some key factors that contribute to this:

    1. Institutional Resistance: Schools and universities may resist new regulations because they often come with additional administrative burdens, costs, or compliance requirements. For instance, appointing a Title VI coordinator at every institution would require staffing, training, and resources that some schools might find challenging or costly. Institutions often lobby against changes that they see as intrusive or expensive.

    2. Political and Legal Considerations: Regulatory updates can be politically sensitive, particularly if they involve contentious issues like civil rights enforcement. Agencies may avoid taking proactive steps without broad public or political support to avoid political blowback or litigation from institutions or other interest groups that oppose the changes.

    3. Limited Resources and Prioritization: Federal agencies have limited resources and often prioritize issues based on public demand, political direction, or the urgency of specific issues. Title VI enforcement may not be seen as a top priority without significant public outcry or high-profile cases drawing attention to it. Title IX, for example, received regulatory updates largely due to increased public attention to issues like sexual harassment and assault.

    4. Need for Stakeholder Input: Agencies typically rely on input from educational institutions, advocacy groups, and the public to gauge how regulatory changes will be received and whether they are necessary. Without significant pressure or demonstrated need, agencies may take a cautious approach to avoid proposing rules that could be seen as overreaching or poorly received. 

        In short, while regulatory updates are possible, agencies often act more cautiously, balancing the need for new rules against the risk of pushback, legal challenges, and resource limitations. Public outcry or advocacy often helps push these issues to the forefront, prompting regulatory changes.

Evidence is sparse, 1 case denial benefits gender, 1 case denial benefits race, 1 case gender/sexual harassment, 1 case race-based harassment 

The above cases resulted in tangible negative outcomes, which motivated reporting, Title VI coverage and Title IX training we currently have covers many more less "serious" scenarios 

Push upstream, the system is broken. 

Wrt Mich, the reporting system was flooded with complaints---proved reporting system broken 

Otherwise---notification system broken 

Literacy broken 

Conflict of interest

No surveys 

There is no way to know whether there is a problem 

What we do know is minorities are severely under represented in certain areas like STEM

It is imperative that the climate they function in is professional 

Like having an HR department, it is necessary to have one at Universities as well 

Mom's stories are similar to that Reddit post. She was systematically denied opportunities based on her womanhood, based on the fact that men that have families to support "needed" the work more. 

- She was paid 30% less than colleagues doing the exact same work

- She was repeatedly asked if she was dating or planning to marry

- She was asked about Dad's work, his income, if he would get tenure as part of her own interviews 

Look at the Title VI and Title IX cases again for post-secondary institutions. Are there cases like the Reddit post? Are there cases related to STEM? 

"regardless of how one feels about the encampment..." is that bias? Did that bias result in an unsafe situation? Isn't he obligated under Title VI not to be biased?

## Background and context


- Title VI

    - “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title VI states that:

    No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” 

- “Education and Title VI” page of the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights

    - Displays "Dear Colleague" letters as guidance

    - One dated May 25th 2023 covered discrimination based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics

        - “As we witness a nationwide rise in reports of antisemitic harassment, including in schools, I write to remind you of schools’ legal obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including Jewish students, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics."

        - Talks about fact sheet "Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics" 

        - "Schools must take immediate and appropriate action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile environment. OCR generally finds that a hostile environment exists where there is harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school."

        - If a hostile environment based on shared ancestry existed, and the school knew or should have known of the hostile environment, OCR will evaluate whether the school met its obligation under Title VI to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent harassment from recurring. In other words, a school violates Title VI when it fails to take adequate steps to address discriminatory harassment, such as antisemitic harassment.”

        - "A broader Title VI inquiry was announced by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in November, investigating universities and K-12 schools for discrimination based on “shared ancestry,” which is harassment based on someone’s ancestry or ethnic characteristics.” 


- Notes on general harassment (not a Title VI violation? but should be part of student training---speech that is disruptive and serves to harass people is no longer protected)

    - 1st Amendment rights are protected based on "time, place, manner" 

    - Speech not following appropriate "time, place, and manner" policies is not protected

        - If certain phrases, mainly, "From the River to the Sea..." are used as a form of harassment, can't they be forced to stop? In other words, it may not be "discrimination" per se, but if its use is sufficiently inappropriate, rules and conduct code against it should apply

            - There is a time and a place for loud chants that can be disruptive to students in class 

                - [TikTok example from 5/24](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNVpURRG/)

            - The big screen that UCLA failed to remove after permit expiration and was disrupting classes 

                - [Conduct that is not protected under the First Amendment](https://www.thefire.org/news/heres-what-students-need-know-about-protesting-campus-right-now)

    - Otherwise based on "totality of circumstances" this language is possibly "actionable"


- For training purposes it might be appropriate to say

    - Following time, place and manner is necessary because policies are in place so that everyone can attend their classes and get their education free from disturbance 

    - Anytime time, place and manner is broken, that message, whatever it might be, can become inappropriate and hurt someone 


- Even protected speech can be "explained away" if UCLA acts as a "guide." When they "stay out of it," protected speech that is derogatory, or controversial can confuse students who may mistake it for hate speech. 

    - “Kohanteb said he feels the university should offer more guidance for students about what constitutes hate speech because he feels some students are ignorant when it comes to antisemitic tropes.“ I’m scared sometimes that hate usually comes from ignorance,” he said. “If we can inform students of what is and what isn’t antisemitic, and where that line is, I think it’d be very beneficial to all.”80

I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,” said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. “I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.””

    - “A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of physical violence perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed.”

    - “Even if it’s nothing political and you just have Arabic writing on your shirt – and it could literally mean sunshine – they will literally call you a terrorist now.”

### Notes

- These are basic needs issues. No educating can occur until these kids are "satisfactorily" helped to adulthood. This "education" may be the most important education kids get at college. Yet somehow their brains are filled with everything but, while this vitally important part is left confused and underdeveloped. 

- The resolution agreements are mandating annual nondiscrimination training. Looks like they'll require this of every institution that has an issue. 

    - Why this isn't perfect

        - These are reactive measures not proactive measures

        - "Systemic Change: Laws and additional regulations provide a foundation for systemic change, ensuring that all institutions uphold certain standards. This helps create a more consistent and equitable environment across all campuses."

        - The institutions themselves determine "how much to care"

        - The institutions themselves are responsible for determining the extent to which they will hold themselves accountable
