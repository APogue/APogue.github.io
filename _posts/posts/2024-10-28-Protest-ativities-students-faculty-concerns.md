Thesis: UCLA can protect free speech on its campus, but it will require it to be more than "a bank that holds classes."


### What do the students and faculty actually want 

- To feel safe on campus

- Less militarization of campus

	- "But if any kind of reconciliation is at all possible, the administration must lay a new foundation for the future. In our view, the process has to begin with this first step.

	Jewish Bruins at UCLA, yet those are precisely the people who will have to live with the reverberations of their
	aggressive actions.
