Thesis: UCLA can protect free speech on its campus, but it will require it to be more than "a bank that holds classes."


### What do the students and faculty actually want 

- To feel safe on campus

- Less militarization of campus

	- "But if any kind of reconciliation is at all possible, the administration must lay a new foundation for the future. In our view, the process has to begin with this first step.

	Apologize."



### Hillel response 

- While their statement is well-meaning, it is the job of the administration to handle *any* violation of the law in a content-neutral manner. They don't need to single out a single group the way Hillel has. But they do need to hold people accountable. It is about safety through accountability---rhetoric, strategic direction, and policy.

	- "The truth is that a largely peaceful, pro-Palestinian encampment was attacked by an angry, violent mob comprised
	of fringe members of the off-campus Jewish community last night. They do not represent the estimated 3,000
	Jewish Bruins at UCLA, yet those are precisely the people who will have to live with the reverberations of their
	aggressive actions. 

		**We can not have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus. Do not fund any actions on campus. Do not protest on campus. Your actions are harming Jewish students."**

		- The funding may be referring to the Go Fund Me campaign that raised 80k



### Injuries

	- "Thistle Boosinger, a 23-year-old member of the encampment, had her hand smashed the night of the violence.

	- "Boosinger underwent surgery in May and is still wearing a brace to protect her hand. She said a detective interviewed her soon after the attack, but that she hasn’t heard anything since.

		“The detective asked me very vaguely if I could pick someone out of a lineup, but she never asked me to actually do it,” Boosinger said. “I don't have any faith in the police.""

	- "Law enforcement did not track injuries from the attack. But according to the encampment’s organizers, more than 150 students “were assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,” and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms to receive treatment for injuries including fractures, severe lacerations and chemical-induced injuries.

		“I actually thought someone would get killed,” said Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, UCLA Hillel’s Director Emeritus, who called 911 around midnight as he watched the violence on live TV. “They came to beat people up.”"

	- "Students also have complained. One third-year student, who declined to give his full name because of retaliation, said the heavy security presence was “complete overkill” and did not make him feel safe. “I don’t feel they are on campus to protect me and my peers,” he said. “I didn’t see them step in when the encampment was being attacked. They had a chance to do something and they procrastinated.”"
