- [Actual filing](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/blair_v_regents_complaint.pdf)

- [Announcement](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBb7iDJy7PT/?hl=en)

- "The ACLU’s argument here likely hinges on distinguishing between **policy-based disruptions that affect university operations and those that impact free speech rights.** They might argue that while the university can regulate based on time, place, and manner to address genuine operational disruptions, **declaring an unlawful assembly solely based on “suspicion” of a policy violation—without imminent or actual disruption—risks suppressing lawful protest.**

	In essence, the ACLU would be pushing for stricter standards (probable cause and the presence of imminent violence or disruption) to prevent the university from prematurely declaring assemblies “unlawful,” emphasizing that **not all policy violations justify breaking up a protest if it doesn't clearly interfere with essential university functions.**"

- [California Penal Code Sec. 407](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=407#:~:text=Whenever%20two%20or%20more%20persons,assembly%20is%20an%20unlawful%20assembly.)

	- "Whenever two or more persons assemble together to do an unlawful act, or do a lawful act in a violent, boisterous, or tumultuous manner, such assembly is an unlawful assembly."

- [California Penal Code Sec. 409](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=409.#:~:text=Every%20person%20remaining%20present%20at,is%20guilty%20of%20a%20misdemeanor.)

	- "Every person remaining present at the place of any riot, rout, or unlawful assembly, after the same has been lawfully warned to disperse, except public officers and persons assisting them in attempting to disperse the same, is guilty of a misdemeanor."

- Key points regarding the above

	- "Intent and Purpose: For an assembly to be deemed unlawful under these sections, there must be evidence of intent to engage in unlawful activities."

	- "Immediate Threat: The use of force or dispersal orders typically requires an immediate threat of violence or disruption." "

		1. Lack of Justifiable Cause: If there was indeed no criminal activity or intent within the encampment, the declaration of an unlawful assembly may lack legal grounding under Penal Code Sections 407 and 409.

		2. Broad Application of Dispersal Orders: Issuing a dispersal order without specific evidence or targeting can be viewed as an overreach of authority, potentially infringing on First Amendment rights related to free speech and assembly.

		3. Policy vs. Law Confusion: The initial message combined "unlawful" (a legal term) with "violates university policy," which, as previously discussed, can create confusion about the basis for enforcement actions.

		4. Due Process Concerns: Arresting individuals without clear evidence of wrongdoing or violating established procedures can raise due process issues, potentially leading to claims of wrongful arrest or suppression of free expression."

- With respect to blockading "

	1. Probable Cause:

		Requirement: Law enforcement must have reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed a specific offense. Application: Must be able to identify and articulate the individual actions that warrant arrest.

	2. Individual Responsibility:

		Principle: Each person is responsible for their own actions. Associating someone with a group activity does not justify arrest unless they are actively participating in wrongdoing.

	3. First Amendment Rights:

		Freedom of Assembly: Protects the right to gather peacefully. Limitations: Does not protect activities that violate laws or disrupt public order, such as blocking essential pathways.

	4. Clear Communication:

		Before Action: Universities should clearly communicate the specific behaviors that are prohibited and the consequences for violating those rules.

	5. Proportional Response:

		Enforcement: Actions taken should be proportionate to the severity of the disruption. Initial steps might include warnings or requests to disperse before escalating to arrests.

	6. Documentation and Evidence:

		Requirement: Authorities should document instances of disruption and ensure there is evidence linking specific individuals to the disruptive behavior."

	7. Obstruction of Public Pathways: 

		Blocking pathways can violate local ordinances or state laws related to obstruction, trespassing, or public safety. Individuals actively engaging in such behavior can be arrested based on these violations.

	8. Intent: 

		Proving intent is crucial. If participants can be shown to have knowingly obstructed pathways with the intent to disrupt university operations, this strengthens the case for their arrest.

	9. Due Process: 

		Any arrests must adhere to due process, ensuring that individuals are informed of the reasons for their arrest and have the opportunity to contest it.

	10. Evidence Collection: 

		Authorities must have clear evidence linking specific individuals to the obstructive actions to justify arrests.

	11. Proportional Response: 

		Enforcement actions should be proportionate to the severity of the disruption. Initial steps might include warnings or dispersal orders before escalating to arrests.

	12. Lack of Intent: 

		Participants might argue they did not intend to disrupt operations or that the encampment's actions were non-violent and within their rights to assemble.

	13. Policy Clarity: 

		If the policy to block pathways was not clearly communicated or was ambiguous, participants might contest their liability.

- The argument with respect to their arrest in the first place,

	- "227. Defendants unlawfully and without legal justification caused the arrest of Plaintiffs Graeme
	Blair and Catherine Washington on May 2, 2024."

	- "228. Defendants caused and effectuated the arrest of Plaintiffs without a warrant and without
	probable cause."

	- "229. Defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Plaintiffs because there was no underlying
	criminal offense that could justify the unlawful assembly declaration, which was based solely on
	violations of university policy, not on the existence of criminality, violence, or the clear and present
	danger of imminent violence, as required under California law. See In re Brown, 9 Cal. 3d at 624 (“An unlawful act within the meaning of section 407 . . . means criminal conduct prohibited by state
	law.”)."

	- "230. Because the unlawful assembly declaration was itself unlawful, there was no probable cause
	to arrest for failure to disperse under California Penal Code section 409, which applies only when an
	individual has been “lawfully warned to disperse.”"

	- "231. Moreover, when Defendants arrested Plaintiffs, they failed to make any effort to distinguish
	between the participants in any unlawful activity and innocent bystanders, as required to carry out a
	lawful arrest for failure to disperse under Penal Code section 409. See Dubner v. City & Cnty. of San
	Francisco, 266 F.3d 959, 967 (9th Cir. 2001)."

- The argument with respect to disciplinary action by the university,



- Events surrounding April 30th

	- Whether the school opts to divest or not, and whatever the reason for why there was divestment in the past versus now are irrelevant to what I care about

	- Looks like the counter-protesters were only there to harass students (see 87.)

		- "88. As the harassers turned violent on the evening of April 28, UCLA administrators did not
		intervene and offered no support to the students inside the otherwise nonviolent encampment. 89. As a result, increasingly larger numbers of individuals harassed, attacked, and attempted to
		dismantle the encampment at UCLA on the evenings of April 29 and April 30."

	- "100. One demonstrator asked a UCLA-hired security guard why they were not assisting the victims of the violence. The guard responded that what those in the encampment were facing was their own fault."

	- "I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,’ they said. ‘I’ve never heard any of my friends scream like that before. … It’s still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.’”"

	- "102. The same report described another student who was hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment’s barricade and their fellow students. This student “said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples. ‘I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,’ the student recalled.”

	- "103. Later reports confirmed that twenty-five pro-Palestine protesters were hospitalized because of injuries inflicted by mob violence."

	- "111. When pushed, he said it was because of “the people that attacked you last night,” saying “[t]he point is to shut down an unsafe situation because we think the people [referring to the mob] are going to come back and we don’t know how many may come back.” 

	- "115. UC and UCLA administrators did not need to shut down the encampment to protect
	individuals inside from future mob activity. They enjoyed ample resources, time, and wherewithal to develop a plan to discourage harassment and violent attacks against the encampment through a
	combination of physical barriers, security, and de-escalation tactics."



### Free speech precedent 

- [Legal precedent explained](https://freespeech.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/core-policies/protected-speech-discrimination-and-harassment#:~:text=Otherwise%20known%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9CFighting,Mason%20Univ.%2C%201991)

	- Like Title IX, legal precedent has significantly narrower protections 

		- "In higher education, the harassing behavior (including speech) must be of a kind that is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institutions’ resources and opportunities.” (Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 1999)."

	- UCLA may not be liable legally, but under Title VI it has an obligation to respond

		- "For almost 3 decades, Title IX has effectively been broader than the Davis standard “because the Department also believes a broader standard is appropriate to enforce Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in the administrative context, in which educational access is the goal and private damages are not at issue.”" (from updates to Title IX doc)

### Task force reports

- [ANTISEMITISM AND ANTI-ISRAELI BIAS AT UCLA](https://antisemitismreport.org/) 

	- [Campus Report on Anti-Semitism at UCLA Released](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1gafzp8/campus_report_on_antisemitism_at_ucla_released/)

		- "it's giving the ADL changing their inclusion of what antisemitism is"

- [REPORT OF TASK FORCE ON ANTI PALESTINIAN, ANTI MUSLIM AND ANTI ARAB RACISM](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/k6qkx97jdfrg61i6vlnxq/CORRECTED-MAY-15-REPORT-OF-TASK-FORCE-ON-ANTI.pdf?rlkey=j82r8gn89i03yclzn6hcxgz3u&e=1&st=6s3n3uvu&dl=0)

	- Looks like the authors are university professors, [Gaye Theresa Johnson](https://afam.ucla.edu/person/gaye-theresa-johnson/)

	- The letter goes through the students' intentions wrt the protest on June 10th

	- "Chancellor Block created the office unilaterally, without a search, a vetting process, faculty or 
	staff input—and not even a consideration that Braziel’s appointment might be temporary or 
	interim. "

	- Pp. 6 costs of policing 

	- Pp. 11 laws around aiming projectiles to disperse crowds

	- Based on video footage the description of police brutality is exaggerated 

	- "Then at one point a UCPD officer shot a student in the chest with a rubber bullet from a distance of 
	about five feet away, surely a violation of the rules for the use of such armaments, which can be 
	lethal at such ranges. The force of the bullet knocked them down and two fellow students assisted 
	them to safety through the bushes. The student suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised 
	lung and was taken by car to the ER at Ronald Reagan Hospital. They remained there for two 
	days given the severity of the injury, which caused elevated cardiac enzymes. This situation could 
	have ended with a permanent disability or death and is a stark reminder of why it is so dangerous 
	to simply transfer control of campus to a militarized police force. Other students were injured as 
	well, one suffering from a concussion, others from bruises and lacerations.3"

	- [Gaza war protesters clash with police at new UCLA encampment](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4715568-gaza-war-student-protesters-police-ucla-encampment/)

		- "UCLA Associate professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student had to go to the hospital after they were hit with a rubber bullet. 

			“They were shot in the chest from 10-15 feet range,” Blair told The Hill."

	- [What Rubber Bullets Can Do to the Human Body](https://slate.com/technology/2024/05/rubber-bullets-blind-kill-trama-ucla-protest.html)

	- [Op-ed: The instructors, staff of Dodd Hall demand that our workplace be restored](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/12/op-ed-the-instructors-staff-of-dodd-hall-demand-that-our-workplace-be-restored), this is the original [letter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScG5AT6nsLoTVo8Ereqj5Oz2pde77Z5m0BNqE9wt_CjEb5ncA/viewform) signed by staff

		- "Many eyewitness reports, including the experiences of several Dodd Hall occupants, as well as documentary video and photographic evidence, support the claim that the violence was incited by police and security, rather than the protesting students."

	- [Footage here shows the kettling](https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1800640869869228490?s=46&t=fKh9XATL-WMti11DkcbvEg) on June 10th

	- The above doc said they were given a dispersal order then kettled. The police press release does say they essentially moved the students around the campus. 

	- Braziel mentioned the best way to conceal security forces would be to put them in blue in gold polo shirts and hide them in buildings, this would effectively make campus feel more like campus. Clearly professors find that disruptive.
