### Lawsuits

- [Lawsuit 2](https://www.aclusocal.org/en/news/ucla-suppressed-student-and-faculty-freedom-speech-so-we-sued-them)

	- [Actual filing](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/blair_v_regents_complaint.pdf)

	- [Announcement](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBb7iDJy7PT/?hl=en)

	- "The ACLU’s argument here likely hinges on distinguishing between policy-based disruptions that affect university operations and those that impact free speech rights. They might argue that while the university can regulate based on time, place, and manner to address genuine operational disruptions, declaring an unlawful assembly solely based on “suspicion” of a policy violation—without imminent or actual disruption—risks suppressing lawful protest.

		In essence, the ACLU would be pushing for stricter standards (probable cause and the presence of imminent violence or disruption) to prevent the university from prematurely declaring assemblies “unlawful,” emphasizing that not all policy violations justify breaking up a protest if it doesn't clearly interfere with essential university functions."

- [Legal precedent explained](https://freespeech.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/core-policies/protected-speech-discrimination-and-harassment#:~:text=Otherwise%20known%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9CFighting,Mason%20Univ.%2C%201991)

	- Like Title IX, legal precedent has significantly narrower protections 

		- "In higher education, the harassing behavior (including speech) must be of a kind that is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institutions’ resources and opportunities.” (Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 1999)."

	- UCLA may not be liable legally, but under Title VI it has an obligation to respond

		- "For almost 3 decades, Title IX has effectively been broader than the Davis standard “because the Department also believes a broader standard is appropriate to enforce Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in the administrative context, in which educational access is the goal and private damages are not at issue.”" (from updates to Title IX doc)


### Congressional Research

- [Israel and Hamas Conflict In Brief: Overview, U.S. Policy, and Options for Congress](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47828)

### Fact checks

- [Atrocities of Oct 7th](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/10/what-we-know-about-three-widespread-israel-hamas-war-claims/)

- [Bisan Owda](https://www.thewrap.com/bisan-owda-emmy-israel-gaza-idf-executions-claim/), unsubstantiated 

- [Propaganda on the number of Palestinians killed](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA2Um1qR26B/?hl=en&img_index=2)

	- Versus Congressional Research Service, updated Oct 4th, "**Conflict, humanitarian situation, and international action.** In the conflict to date, more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry there. Additionally, about 90% of Gaza’s some 2.1 million residents have been displaced, with most facing unsanitary, overcrowded conditions alongside acute shortages of food, water, medical care, and other essential supplies and services. Obstacles to transporting aid through crossings and Israeli checkpoints and then safely delivering it have contributed to high levels of food insecurity. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) as of August 2024, humanitarian aid was probably preventing famine, but “hunger and malnutrition remain dire, and hunger-related mortality is likely still occurring.”"

- [IDF X on terrorist arrests](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1847644148355993827)

- [Facebook and Insta restrict red triangle usage](https://www.instagram.com/muslim/p/DA55NaXOU0x/?img_index=1)

	- Association with Hamas, the red triangle is a "military target"

	- Association with concentration camps

	- Trump's ads were pulled 

- Has CAC created an observable pattern of messaging that, 

	- Promotes unverified, negative claims about Israel (e.g., accusations of atrocities without evidence),

	- Frames violent acts against Israelis as justified “resistance,” and

	- Perpetuates narratives that cast Israelis or Jewish students as complicit in perceived injustices,

- [UCLABIPAC](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/)

	- "There is so much propaganda that those are quote-unquote Israelis, those are settlers."

	- Denial of benefits

- "Exactly. By making Israeli = Settler and Settler = Zionist, the logic becomes transitive: Israeli = Zionist. This framing effectively removes any distinction between national identity and political ideology, equating simply being Israeli with adherence to a specific political stance (Zionism) and even further, with the idea of being a “settler.”"

- Blurring of Identity and Ideology:

	- This approach collapses nationality into ideology, treating anyone who is Israeli as inherently supportive of Zionist policies, regardless of their personal beliefs or political stance. It ignores the diversity of thought within Israel, where there is a wide spectrum of perspectives on issues like the occupation, settlements, and peace with Palestinians. It also misrepresents the reality of Jewish and Israeli identities, which can’t be neatly categorized by political ideology, as Zionism itself has multiple interpretations.

	- By labeling all Israelis as “settlers,” proponents of this view essentially reject Zionism in any form---not just the presence of Israelis in the West Bank or Gaza, but the idea of the state of Israel.

	- This view, while critical of Zionism, extends beyond policy disagreements and touches on identity. By conflating Israeli identity with Zionism and settler-colonialism, it labels all Israelis as participants in a colonial project, regardless of their individual beliefs, actions, or even ethnic background.

		- It is theoretically possible that there exists Israelis who believe in the dissolution of the Israeli state 

- Equate it to American:

	- American = Settler = Deserving of harm at the hands of the original inhabitants of this land. Then by the same logic this individual also deserves to die. 

- Defined logical implication that all Israelis are Zionists:

	- In this framework, to be Israeli is equated with being a Zionist inherently. The logic is that any Israeli presence in the land, regardless of location or borders, represents Zionism or “settler colonialism.” This view rejects the idea that someone can be Israeli without being a Zionist, meaning it dismisses the possibility of Israelis who might be critical of Zionist policies, supportive of Palestinian rights, or against the occupation. Essentially, it equates national identity with ideology, with no room for variation.
