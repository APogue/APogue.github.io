	- Association with concentration camps

	- Trump's ads were pulled 

- Has CAC created an observable pattern of messaging that, 

	- Promotes unverified, negative claims about Israel (e.g., accusations of atrocities without evidence),

	- Frames violent acts against Israelis as justified “resistance,” and

	- Perpetuates narratives that cast Israelis or Jewish students as complicit in perceived injustices,

- [UCLABIPAC](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/)

	- "There is so much propaganda that those are quote-uquote Israelis, those are settlers."

	- Denial of benefits

- "Exactly. By making Israeli = Settler and Settler = Zionist, the logic becomes transitive: Israeli = Zionist. This framing effectively removes any distinction between national identity and political ideology, equating simply being Israeli with adherence to a specific political stance (Zionism) and even further, with the idea of being a “settler.”"

- Blurring of Identity and Ideology:

	- This approach collapses nationality into ideology, treating anyone who is Israeli as inherently supportive of Zionist policies, regardless of their personal beliefs or political stance. It ignores the diversity of thought within Israel, where there is a wide spectrum of perspectives on issues like the occupation, settlements, and peace with Palestinians. It also misrepresents the reality of Jewish and Israeli identities, which can’t be neatly categorized by political ideology, as Zionism itself has multiple interpretations.

	- By labeling all Israelis as “settlers,” proponents of this view essentially reject Zionism in any form---not just the presence of Israelis in the West Bank or Gaza, but the idea of the state of Israel.

	- This view, while critical of Zionism, extends beyond policy disagreements and touches on identity. By conflating Israeli identity with Zionism and settler-colonialism, it labels all Israelis as participants in a colonial project, regardless of their individual beliefs, actions, or even ethnic background.

		- It is theoretically possible that there exists Israelis who believe in the dissolution of the Israeli state 

- Equate it to American:

	- American = Settler = Deserving of harm at the hands of the original inhabitants of this land. Then by the same logic this individual also deserves to die. 

- Defined logical implication that all Israelis are Zionists:

	- In this framework, to be Israeli is equated with being a Zionist inherently. The logic is that any Israeli presence in the land, regardless of location or borders, represents Zionism or “settler colonialism.” This view rejects the idea that someone can be Israeli without being a Zionist, meaning it dismisses the possibility of Israelis who might be critical of Zionist policies, supportive of Palestinian rights, or against the occupation. Essentially, it equates national identity with ideology, with no room for variation.
