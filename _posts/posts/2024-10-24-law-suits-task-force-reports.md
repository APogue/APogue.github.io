	- "It also calls for an injunction that would bar UCLA from giving orders to disperse based solely on suspected breaches of university policies, which the lawsuit says unfairly target pro-Palestinian voices."


### Lawsuits

- [Lawsuit 2](https://www.aclusocal.org/en/news/ucla-suppressed-student-and-faculty-freedom-speech-so-we-sued-them)

	- [Actual filing](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/blair_v_regents_complaint.pdf)

	- [Announcement](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBb7iDJy7PT/?hl=en)

	- "The ACLU’s argument here likely hinges on distinguishing between **policy-based disruptions that affect university operations and those that impact free speech rights.** They might argue that while the university can regulate based on time, place, and manner to address genuine operational disruptions, **declaring an unlawful assembly solely based on “suspicion” of a policy violation—without imminent or actual disruption—risks suppressing lawful protest.**

		In essence, the ACLU would be pushing for stricter standards (probable cause and the presence of imminent violence or disruption) to prevent the university from prematurely declaring assemblies “unlawful,” emphasizing that **not all policy violations justify breaking up a protest if it doesn't clearly interfere with essential university functions.**"

	- Notes on this lawsuit---------------------------------------

		- Whether the school opts to divest or not, and whatever the reason for why there was divestment in the past versus now are irrelevant to what I care about

		- Looks like the counter-protesters were only there to harass students (see 87.)

			- "88. As the harassers turned violent on the evening of April 28, UCLA administrators did not
			intervene and offered no support to the students inside the otherwise nonviolent encampment. 89. As a result, increasingly larger numbers of individuals harassed, attacked, and attempted to
			dismantle the encampment at UCLA on the evenings of April 29 and April 30."

		- "100. One demonstrator asked a UCLA-hired security guard why they were not assisting the victims of the violence. The guard responded that what those in the encampment were facing was their own fault."

		- "I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,’ they said. ‘I’ve never heard any of my friends scream like that before. … It’s still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.’”"

		- "102. The same report described another student who was hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment’s barricade and their fellow students. This student “said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples. ‘I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,’ the student recalled.”

		- "103. Later reports confirmed that twenty-five pro-Palestine protesters were hospitalized because of injuries inflicted by mob violence."

		- "111. When pushed, he said it was because of “the people that attacked you last night,” saying “[t]he point is to shut down an unsafe situation because we think the people [referring to the mob] are going to come back and we don’t know how many may come back.” 

		- "115. UC and UCLA administrators did not need to shut down the encampment to protect
		individuals inside from future mob activity. They enjoyed ample resources, time, and wherewithal to develop a plan to discourage harassment and violent attacks against the encampment through a
		combination of physical barriers, security, and de-escalation tactics."



- [Legal precedent explained](https://freespeech.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/core-policies/protected-speech-discrimination-and-harassment#:~:text=Otherwise%20known%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9CFighting,Mason%20Univ.%2C%201991)

	- Like Title IX, legal precedent has significantly narrower protections 

		- "In higher education, the harassing behavior (including speech) must be of a kind that is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institutions’ resources and opportunities.” (Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 1999)."

	- UCLA may not be liable legally, but under Title VI it has an obligation to respond

		- "For almost 3 decades, Title IX has effectively been broader than the Davis standard “because the Department also believes a broader standard is appropriate to enforce Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in the administrative context, in which educational access is the goal and private damages are not at issue.”" (from updates to Title IX doc)

	- Looks like the authors are university professors, [Gaye Theresa Johnson](https://afam.ucla.edu/person/gaye-theresa-johnson/)

	- The letter goes through the students' intentions wrt the protest on June 10th

	- "Chancellor Block created the office unilaterally, without a search, a vetting process, faculty or 
	staff input—and not even a consideration that Braziel’s appointment might be temporary or 
	interim. "

	- Pp. 6 costs of policing 

	- Pp. 11 laws around aiming projectiles to disperse crowds

	- Based on video footage the description of police brutality is exaggerated 

	- "Then at one point a UCPD officer shot a student in the chest with a rubber bullet from a distance of 
	about five feet away, surely a violation of the rules for the use of such armaments, which can be 
	lethal at such ranges. The force of the bullet knocked them down and two fellow students assisted 
	them to safety through the bushes. The student suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised 
	lung and was taken by car to the ER at Ronald Reagan Hospital. They remained there for two 
	days given the severity of the injury, which caused elevated cardiac enzymes. This situation could 
	have ended with a permanent disability or death and is a stark reminder of why it is so dangerous 
	to simply transfer control of campus to a militarized police force. Other students were injured as 
	well, one suffering from a concussion, others from bruises and lacerations.3"

	- [Gaza war protesters clash with police at new UCLA encampment](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4715568-gaza-war-student-protesters-police-ucla-encampment/)

		- "UCLA Associate professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student had to go to the hospital after they were hit with a rubber bullet. 

			“They were shot in the chest from 10-15 feet range,” Blair told The Hill."

	- [Op-ed: The instructors, staff of Dodd Hall demand that our workplace be restored](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/12/op-ed-the-instructors-staff-of-dodd-hall-demand-that-our-workplace-be-restored), this is the original [letter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScG5AT6nsLoTVo8Ereqj5Oz2pde77Z5m0BNqE9wt_CjEb5ncA/viewform) signed by staff

		- "Many eyewitness reports, including the experiences of several Dodd Hall occupants, as well as documentary video and photographic evidence, support the claim that the violence was incited by police and security, rather than the protesting students."

	- [Footage here shows the kettling](https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1800640869869228490?s=46&t=fKh9XATL-WMti11DkcbvEg) on June 10th

	- The above doc said they were given a dispersal order then kettled. The police press release does say they essentially moved the students around the campus. 

	- Braziel mentioned the best way to conceal security forces would be to put them in blue in gold polo shirts and hide them in buildings, this would effectively make campus feel more like campus. Clearly professors find that disruptive.
