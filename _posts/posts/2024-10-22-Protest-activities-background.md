### Background and context 

- Free speech and academic freedom 
	
	- Qualification of knowledge for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety is a societal construct. Truth is absolute.

	- This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

	- Especially important with regard to unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities---the lifeblood of human evolution

	- Content neutrality, two-way street 

- In contention with 

	- 1st Amendment exceptions narrowly defined

		- True threats

		- Defamation 

	- 14th Amendment rights (getting too heady, USAC stuff in this doc?)

		- Anti-discrimination policy

			- Severe and/or pervasive, must interfere with access to education 

		- Title VI 

			- Totality of circumstances

			- Rhetoric motivated by bias

	- Time, place, and manner

		- Content-neutral, what is applied to one must be applied to all

### Handling of free speech since Oct 7th

- Illustrate free speech, protected 

	- Extreme political positions

		- Moshiach flag guy 

	- Includes protections for instances of shocking messaging or hate speech 

		- [Example 1](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/)

		- [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17k6sx8/islamophobes_on_campus/)

- May cause tensions to flare, UCLA won't get involved 

	- February rally 

		- Heckling 

- Free speech gray area

	- When "equal rights give way to free speech"---UCLA permits more extreme cases of discrimination

		- Did not remove it, waited to condemn it 

		- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

			- Made it into social media posts, Op-eds, news articles 

	- Instances of discrimination quietly removed

		- Students mentioned they wanted to leave campus due to "clear signs of discrimination" happening 

		- Triangles made it into several articles as the "face of the protest"
	
		- No acknowledgment

### Protest 

- Hate speech at the protest 

	- hate speech coming from counter-protesters

	- hate speech coming from protesters

	- reddit, daily bruin, tiktok

- Students started blockading pathways and excluding students

	- insta, tiktok 

- Then UCLA stepped in 



### Quotes 

- “Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by 	the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and 			Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. ‘I feel very uncomfortable,’ he said. ‘I might skip my 		classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on 			campus.’” [Student onlookers express differing opinions on pro-Palestine encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment)
