Thesis: What is UC and UCLA philosophy? (insert the quote about even the smallest thing mattering from the 2024 toolkit)

Thesis1: The philosophy of the school is handling that is content-neutral

Thesis2: The philosophy of the schools is the support of academic freedom

Thesis3: The philosophy of the school is freedom of speech

Thesis4: Free speech is not an unconditional constitutional right

Thesis4: It would appear as though school involvement and oversight are in circumstances where protest activities interfere with UCLA's public image. Rather than legal conditions, it would appear as though these are the conditions under which UCLA gets involved. 

### Background and context 

- Free speech and academic freedom 
	
	- Qualification of knowledge for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety is a societal construct. Truth is absolute.

	- This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

	- Especially important with regard to unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities---the lifeblood of human evolution

	- Content neutrality, two-way street 

- In contention with 

	- 1st Amendment exceptions narrowly defined

		- True threats (give an example)

		- Defamation (give an example)

	- 14th Amendment rights (getting too heady, USAC stuff in this doc?)

		- Anti-discrimination policy

			- Severe and/or pervasive, must interfere with access to education 

		- Title VI 

			- Totality of circumstances

			- Rhetoric motivated by bias

	- Time, place, and manner

		- Content-neutral, what is applied to one must be applied to all

### Handling of free speech since Oct 7th

- Illustrate free speech, protected 

	- Extreme political positions

		- Moshiach flag guy 

	- Includes protections for instances of shocking messaging or hate speech 

		- [Example 1](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/)

		- [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17k6sx8/islamophobes_on_campus/)

- May cause tensions to flare, UCLA won't get involved 

	- February rally 

		- Heckling 

	- Sunday before April 30th (Myers article)

- Free speech gray area

	- When "equal rights give way to free speech"---UCLA permits more extreme cases of discrimination

		- Did not remove it, waited to condemn it 

		- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

			- Made it into social media posts, Op-eds, news articles (which news articles?)

	- Instances of discrimination quietly removed

		- Students mentioned they wanted to leave campus due to "clear signs of discrimination" happening 

		- Triangles made it into several articles as the "face of the protest"
	
		- No acknowledgment

### Protest 

- Hate speech at the protest 

	- hate speech coming from counter-protesters

		- "A counter-protester smashed the finger of a protester inside using a wooden slab at around 12:28 a.m. Counter-protesters also shouted an anti-Black racial slur at around the same time." [Pro-Israel counter-protesters attempt to storm encampment, sparking violence](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/01/pro-israel-counter-protesters-attempt-to-storm-encampment-sparking-violence)

	- hate speech coming from protesters

	- reddit, daily bruin, tiktok

- Students started blockading pathways and excluding students

	- insta, tiktok 

- Then UCLA stepped in (this is the tie in with "UCLA handling doc")

	- No condemnation of hate speech 

	- Allows the sides to become embroiled in conflict 

### True disruptions to campus operations 

- Encampment blockading 

	- Reddit---people can't get to class, their jobs, disabled people are denied access to campus

- The marching through the halls with chants of "From the River to the Sea" (TikTok)

	- [Pro-Palestinian protesters took over UCLA's Dodd Hall](https://www.tiktok.com/@journalistjeremy/video/7372692453956062507)

- The screen that UCLA permitted to stay without permit 

	- Reddit quote

	- [Hillel comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HqCOvk9-i0iW2xlYqvjQGyzjWDmIzjn/view), "There is a screen placed by community members at UCLA playing the horrors of October 7th on repeat--and we
	can’t learn over the constant noise of Jews being slaughtered. The wider community is prioritizing their own idea of
	activism over what Jewish students want. We want peace and a diplomatic resolution."


### Quotes 

- “Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by 	the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and 			Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. ‘I feel very uncomfortable,’ he said. ‘I might skip my 		classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on 			campus.’” [Student onlookers express differing opinions on pro-Palestine encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment)


- [Unmasking counterprotesters who attacked UCLA’s pro-Palestine encampment](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html)

	- "‘You guys are about to get f—ed up’
	In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment."
