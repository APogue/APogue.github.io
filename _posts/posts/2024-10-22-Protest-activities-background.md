### Background and context 

- Open to public 

- Free speech and academic freedom 
	
	- Qualification of knowledge for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety is a societal construct. Truth is absolute.

	- This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

	- Especially important with regard to unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities---the lifeblood of human evolution

	- Content neutrality, two-way street 

- In contention with 

	- 1st Amendment exceptions narrowly defined

		- True threats

		- Defamation 

	- 14th Amendment rights 

		- Anti-discrimination policy

		- Title VI 

### Handling of free speech since Oct 7th

- Illustrate free speech, protected 

	- Extreme political positions

	- Includes protections for instances of shocking messaging or hate speech 

- May cause tensions to flare, UCLA won't get involved 

	- February rally 

		- Heckling 

- Free speech gray area

	- When "equal rights give way to free speech"---UCLA permits more extreme cases of discrimination

		- Did not remove it, waited to condemn it 

		- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

			- Made it into social media posts, Op-eds, news articles 

	- Instances of discrimination quietly removed

		- Students mentioned they wanted to leave campus due to "clear signs of discrimination" happening 

		- Triangles made it into several articles as the "face of the protest"
	
		- No acknowledgment

### Protest 

- Hate speech at the protest 

- Students started blockading pathways and excluding students

- Then UCLA stepped in
