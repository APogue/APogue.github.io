## Introduction

- Draw a connection between what is happening on the national level and UCLA: the antisemitic activity that occurred in D.C. during Netanyahu visit 
	
	- Graffiti at UCLA

	- Similar symbolism at the UCLA protest 

	- Lavie Levi's statement

- Opening incident: The protest itself---the intention was to bring UCLA to the table but nothing productive came of the week-long encampment, rallies and protests. The only lasting result---serious incidents involving discrimination and violence 

	- Eli Tsives blocked from entering an area of campus (taken on video)

		- He made a point to emphasize "that he pays tuition"

	- Physical barriers were also in place to keep so-called "Zionists" out

		- Masked non-affiliates with weapons attacked the encampment

- Transitional statement

	- There was clear rule breaking on both sides, so why did UCLA allow it to continue for days until things got completely out of hand? 

- Thesis statement: A lack of oversight by UCLA administration has led to problematic incidents involving discrimination and violence

## Background and Context

- UCLA philosophy: 
	
	1. ["Academic freedom in its fullest terms"](https://www.ucla.edu/about/mission-and-values)

		- [1st amendment rights as a student at UCLA](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media)

		- Block's House Opening Remarks - constitutional freedoms above everything

		- [ACLU weighs in](https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-urges-congress-to-oppose-anti-semitism-awareness-act) 

			- (Not passed the senate, [H.R. 6090](https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr6090/BILLS-118hr6090eh.pdf), [criticized](https://raskin.house.gov/2024/5/rep-raskin-statement-on-h-r-6090) for being symbolic, too vague)

			- The question of Israel's statehood is "political" and protected
			
			- Harassment based on this speech, however, is not protected

	2. Self-governance

		- UCLA takes a very hands-off approach to guidance and oversight based on these principles 

		- USAC charges mandatory fees from student tuition in order to run a large portion of undergraduate life

			- [not all fees are at USAC discretion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/mtr3ns/what_is_usac_a_sort_of_brief_guide/)

				- [fee breakdown](https://www.usac.ucla.edu/funding/student-fee)

				- [more recent fees paid number](https://sa.ucla.edu/RO/Fees/Public/public-fees?year=2023-2024&term=Annual&degree=Undergraduate%20cohort%202023-24)

	3. UCLA "expects" students to function autonomously using value systems in place

		- photo of the statue

		- [Mary Osako statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/campus-condemns-antisemitic-caricature-at-uc-regents-meeting)

			- True Bruin Values

			- Principles of community

	4. "Student safety" is a concern because the campus is open to the public

		- [UCLA is a land-grant institution](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa/how-we-work/partnerships/land-grant-colleges-universities)

		- [This makes UCLA open-access](https://dailybruin.com/2024/01/29/uclas-open-campus-raises-questions-around-student-safety)

- How does UCLA policy support the above? Where there is a lack of systems, what patterns have emerged? 

	- Policies, reporting, consequences
