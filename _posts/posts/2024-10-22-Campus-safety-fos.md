Thesis: UCLA wants free speech at any cost i.e. safety, equality, and freedom of speech. UCLA is cannabalizing its own mission. UCLA can protect free speech on its campus, but it will require it to be more than "a bank that holds classes."


### Background and context 

- Open to public 

- Free speech and academic freedom 
	
	- Qualification of knowledge for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety is a societal construct. Truth is absolute.

	- This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

	- Especially important with regard to unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities---the lifeblood of human evolution

	- Content neutrality, two-way street 

- In contention with 

	- 1st Amendment exceptions 

		- True threats

		- Defamation 

	- 14th Amendment rights 

		- Anti-discrimination policy

		- Title VI 

### Incidents occurring after Oct 7th

- Illustrate what UCLA intends for free speech

	- Extreme political positions

	- Includes protections for instances of shocking messaging or hate speech 

- Illustrate what happens when free speech is not protected (Oct 11th incident at Kaplan)

	- The students were furthering "the mission of the university" because they were on the frontier of theoretical knowledge 

	- Only Hillel condemned it 

	- Non-affiliates clearly broke the law, UCLA conduct policy and UCLA non-affiliate conduct policy 

		- Arrested for intimidation, property damage, attempted assault characterized by bias 

		- Cited for harassment and disruption of university operations

		- No-contact order 

	- They were permitted to leave the premises 

	- Condemnation (or lack thereof)

		- By staff at an event

- Nov 7th and 8th incidents

	- Condemned by Block and Drake (vague and broad to address all incidents in the past month)

- Illustrate when "equal rights give way to free speech", i.e. UCLA permits more extreme cases of discrimination

	- Did not remove it, waited to condemn it 

	- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

### Protests 

- Instances of discrimination going unacknowledged 










### Post-protest events 

- Police handling 






### Effects of imbalanced handling 

- The conflating of protected and unprotected activity is always in service of the negative handling of pro-Palestinian students

- There is a pattern showing a lack of siding with pro-Palestinian protesters via punishment, statement omissions, or a negative administrative tone

- The UC non-discrimination policy

	- “Training and Education for the Respondent: • If an individual is found to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct under the policy, the respondent may be required to undergo training as a corrective or remedial measure. • The respondent may also need to participate in periodic refresher classes to reinforce appropriate behavior and compliance with anti-discrimination standards.”

	- By the UC anti-discrimination policy, respondents are subject to anti-discrimination training and education. By failing to hold the discriminating persons accountable, they are effectively denying them access to a Title VI education.

- Discrimination that crosses the line opens the door for teachable moments 

	- Forces students to communicate using legal free speech

	- This will aid in becoming more effective communicators after college

	- It also opens the forum for civil discourse---a more meaningful use of time and resources 

	- Denying them anti-discrimination education means they do not care about these individuals and they do not care about campus climate. 

- Where is the line? UCLA has made no effort to define it

	- What is pervasive? What is severe? Who is tallying the totality of the circumstances so that when the line is crossed, it can be stopped before students are denied equal access to education?

	- Ignoring instances of clear discrimination as part of a broader construct set up in the disservice of this group of students

	- It is fueling the flames of divide between student groups

- Not truly committed to content-neutral student management

- Not truly committed to a legal, free speech environment

- Chilling of free speech

	- Due to imbalanced discipline and policing

- Denial of benefits---access to education 

	- due to injury, fear and intimidation
