Thesis: UCLA wants free speech at any cost i.e. safety, equality, and freedom of speech. 


### Background and context 

- Open to public 

- Free speech and academic freedom 
	
	- Qualification of knowledge for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety is a societal construct. Truth is absolute.

	- This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

	- Especially important with regard to unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities---the lifeblood of human evolution

	- Content neutrality, two-way street 

- In contention with 

	- 1st Amendment exceptions 

	- 14th Amendment rights 

### Incidents occurring after Oct 7th

- Illustrate what UCLA intends for free speech

	-
