### Title IX still has a demonstrated need for *academic* and *on-campus* training scenarios 

- What are the Clery training requirements?

- What are the UCLA training topics?

	- Do the training again

	- Some of the topics may go beyond what is required

- There is a gap with respect to on-campus issues that are covered by Title IX

	- 2020 amendments included a definition of sexual harassment 

	- AAU definition of sexual harassment 

	- How pervasive is sexual harassment?

		- Check UCLA annual Accountability 

		- GW Annual Title IX

		- AAU Survey 

### Post-secondary schools have issues with accountability 

- Sexual assault is still pervasive 

- From 2015 to 2019 students have a better understanding of what constitutes assault (SaVE training is working)

- But students are not reporting 

	- AAU survey shows about 1/3 of students report incidents

	- AAU survey only shows a slight improvement in reporting awareness

	- UCUES shows mediocre reporting awareness

	- SCU policy site says Title IX is learned by word of mouth

	- Title IX training at UCLA does not mention the Title IX Coordinator at all 

		- The Title IX Office notification is buried within the legal documents

	- There are barriers to reporting

		- Title IX Coordinator awareness can reduce other barriers

- School accountability is largely voluntary

	- Title IX "jurisdiction" is the largest, it covers anywhere students interact

	- Title IX accountability reporting is voluntary

	- Clery accountability reports are mandatory 

	- Clery jurisdiction is significantly smaller 

		- School and official school-affiliated locations

			- Many schools do not even guarantee 4 years of housing 

		- SCU dissociated completely from its [fraternity and sorority system](https://dh.scu.edu/exhibits/exhibits/show/greeklifescu), yet still, today, "with six Fraternities and five Sororities, more than twenty-five percent of Santa Clara students are involved in Greek life."

			- Serious fraternity-related [assault is occurring](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/04/santa-clara-university-students-demand-action-from-school-after-multiple-sexual-assault-allegations/amp/), wrt these events, the administration took a "my word versus yours" position. They claimed incidents were not happening because reports were not being made.

			- They are not under Clery jurisdiction 

			- It is moot because reporting culture is said to be "poor" at SCU

			- They do not have a Title IX accountability report to indicate efforts at transparency or concern for student safety and well-being
