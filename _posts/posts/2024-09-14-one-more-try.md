### Title IX training

- Clery training requirements

	- requires "recognition" ie literacy

- Title IX posting requirements

	- key elements

- Both of the above require that the student be trained or notified *at least* once

### School accountability is largely voluntary

- Title IX "jurisdiction" is the largest, it covers anywhere students interact

- Title IX accountability reporting is voluntary

- Clery accountability reports are mandatory 

- Clery jurisdiction is significantly smaller 

	- School and official school-affiliated locations

		- Many schools do not even guarantee 4 years of housing 

	- SCU dissociated completely from its [fraternity and sorority system](https://dh.scu.edu/exhibits/exhibits/show/greeklifescu), yet still, today, "with six Fraternities and five Sororities, more than twenty-five percent of Santa Clara students are involved in Greek life."

		- Serious fraternity-related [assault is occurring](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/04/santa-clara-university-students-demand-action-from-school-after-multiple-sexual-assault-allegations/amp/). Wrt these events, the administration took a "my word versus yours" position. They claimed incidents were not happening because reports were not being made. 

			- [Another article](https://www.ktvu.com/news/sexual-assaults-go-largely-unreported-santa-clara-university-and-students-talk-disparity-in-numbers), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCU/comments/12snkpf/how_bad_is_sexual_assault_at_scu/), [Reddit2](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCU/comments/17yppxz/give_it_to_me_straight_how_is_scu_i_need_the_real/), [Reddit3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCU/comments/el64lo/greek_life_reputation/), "If you like drinking all day, being a dick, getting hazed, and trying to force girls to fornicate, scu greek life is for you." 
			
		- They are not under Clery jurisdiction 

		- It is moot because reporting culture is said to be "poor" at SCU

			- A story (I did not ask to publish formally and do not plan to) from a current student---one fraternity at SCU has a policy for handling assault internally. Where they ask girls to list assault in an "accountability book" so they can hold brothers accountable themselves, with the worst repercussions being expulsion from the frat; no school or police involvement whatsoever. This was apparently the idea of the new frat president after the previous frat president was expelled from the frat for assault. 

			- There are no means for proving this from online sources. I can only quote a website saying "people don't report at SCU"

		- They do not have a Title IX accountability report to indicate efforts at transparency or concern for student safety and well-being 


### Students are not reporting in general

- Sexual assault is still pervasive 

- From 2015 to 2019 students have a better understanding of what constitutes assault (SaVE training is working)

- But students are not reporting 

	- AAU survey shows about 1/3 of students report incidents

	- AAU survey shows students are less likely to report after their freshman year

	- AAU survey only shows a slight improvement in reporting awareness

	- UCUES shows mediocre reporting awareness

	- SCU policy site says Title IX is learned by word of mouth

	- There are barriers to reporting

		- Title IX Coordinator awareness can reduce other barriers

		- A posting requirement wrt Title IX Coordinators may be insufficient 


### A single training and notification session is not sufficient 

- Elements like the "forgetting curve" or misalignment with "learning styles" can affect information retention

- Personally I know one who is rushing can come out of the training having learned basically nothing 

	- I am not at risk 

	- I clicked through things as fast as I could and didn't read much

	- The jargon, like "Title IX" at first exposure is alienating and foreign. It can represent a barrier to learning. 

- One must be an interested party in order to take the training seriously 

	- A friend has experienced assault

	- The person themselves have come close to or experienced some degree of assault themselves

	- The student has heard rumors about SVSH issues occurring at some social event 

- Therefor, one training session *is not sufficient*

	- A student may not be an interested party until *after* the first training session 

	- If they, like me, did not pay attention during the first training, they are not equipped to handle SVSH

















### Title IX still has a demonstrated need for *academic* and *on-campus* training scenarios 

- There is a gap with respect to on-campus issues that are covered by Title IX

	- 2020 amendments included a definition of sexual harassment 

	- AAU definition of sexual harassment 

	- How pervasive is sexual harassment?

		- Check UCLA annual Accountability 

		- GW Annual Title IX

		- AAU Survey 

- Not enough coverage, and not covered in appropriate context 

	- Training is "out of place with SV, IPV, and stalking"
