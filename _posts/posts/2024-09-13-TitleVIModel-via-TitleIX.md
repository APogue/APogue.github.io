### Title IX Isn't Perfect

- Go into the core areas of Title IX that should be the backbone of Title VI 

	- The loop 

		- 1. Publication of notification 

		- 2. Literacy wrt rights means two things. They need to be able to recognize when situations arise--- 1. for prevention measures or 2. for reporting purposes

		- 3. Know who to report to 

		- 4. Trust the reporting system

- But there are ongoing issues wrt Title IX, describe them here

	- Assault continues to be pervasive

		- 21 school survey

	- No one is reporting, there are several barriers to reporting

		- Incident statistics vs reporting statistics 

		- What are the barriers

		- No one knows the Title IX Coordinator exists or what their actual role is

			- UCUES, 21 school survey, SCU 

			- Knowing reflexively about the Title IX coordinator can help reduce other barriers

		- There's anxiety about possible outcomes 

			- The goal should be to encourage people, if nothing else, to just submit a report 

				- The Clery Reporting system is useless if incidents are not reported

					- SCU article vs their Clery Report

				- It should be clear to students first and foremost that an arrest does not have to be made and a Title IX investigation does not need to be initiated

					- Beyond this step, they should trust that the grievance process is discrete and fair 




- For *both* Title IX and Title VI, *in the training*, they need to be *promoting a culture of reporting and safety*

	- Undue burden wrt Coordinator buried in legal material 

	- Why is there a stigma in talking about SVSH? Why don't we know how pervasive SVSH is? Why aren't students surveyed? 

		- How can anyone have any idea if the number of reports coming in reflects a working loop without surveying the students? Is this not a concern for the well-being of the students?
