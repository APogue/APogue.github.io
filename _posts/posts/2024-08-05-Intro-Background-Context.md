## Introduction

- Draw a connection between what is happening on the national level and UCLA: the antisemitic activity that occurred in D.C. during Netanyahu visit 
	
	- Graffiti at UCLA

	- Similar symbolism at the UCLA protest 

	- Lavie Levi's statement

- Opening incident: The protest itself---the intention was to bring UCLA to the table but nothing productive came of the week-long encampment, rallies and protests. The only lasting result---serious incidents involving discrimination and violence 

	- Eli Tsives blocked from entering an area of campus (taken on video)

		- He made a point to emphasize "that he pays tuition"

	- Physical barriers were also in place to keep so-called "Zionists" out

		- Masked non-affiliates with weapons attacked the encampment

- Transitional statement

	- There was clear rule breaking on both sides, so why did UCLA allow it to continue for days until things got completely out of hand? 

- Thesis statement: A lack of oversight by UCLA administration has led to problematic incidents involving discrimination and violence

## Background and Context

- UCLA is the most popular university in the US by application 

- UCLA philosophy: 
	
	1. ["Academic freedom in its fullest terms"](https://www.ucla.edu/about/mission-and-values)

		- [1st amendment rights as a student at UCLA](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media)

		- Block's House Opening Remarks - constitutional freedoms above everything

		- [ACLU weighs in](https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-urges-congress-to-oppose-anti-semitism-awareness-act) 

			- (Not passed the senate, [H.R. 6090](https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr6090/BILLS-118hr6090eh.pdf), [criticized](https://raskin.house.gov/2024/5/rep-raskin-statement-on-h-r-6090) for being symbolic, too vague)

			- The question of Israel's statehood is "political" and protected
			
			- Harassment based on this speech, however, is not protected

	2. Self-governance

		- UCLA takes a very hands-off approach to guidance and oversight based on these principles 

			- Positions on issues taken by student governments are not positions taken by the university (by PACAOS-63.00)

		- USAC has a set of [bylaws](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/6641d05eb7443b3f12156677/1715994667939/bylaws.2023-05-09.pdf#page=1) 

			- I.D. Conflict of Interest

				- Discrimination represents a conflict of interest when involved in political activity 

			- II.E. Removal Process

				- The process for initiating a hearing solely based on the identification of cause

				- Removal from Council requires 2/3 vote

		- UC student government has the [right to take positions on public issues](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710526/PACAOS-60)

			- UCLA USAC's own constitution is more specific in limiting powers

		- USAC [constitution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/6509389145a9b930a19e0401/1695103121405/USA+Constitution.pdf)

			- Preamble

			- I.D. USAC shall not participate in discrimination 

			- II.B.3.a. 

				- rights of students to participate in all activities 

				- rights of students to a fair hearing of grievances

		- USAC charges [mandatory fees](https://sole.ucla.edu/file/cfdd57d7-15e0-4d9d-a6bf-e5ce5e91e385) from student tuition in order to run a large portion of undergraduate life

			- [not all fees are at USAC discretion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/mtr3ns/what_is_usac_a_sort_of_brief_guide/)

				- [fee breakdown](https://www.usac.ucla.edu/funding/student-fee)

				- [more recent fees paid number](https://sa.ucla.edu/RO/Fees/Public/public-fees?year=2023-2024&term=Annual&degree=Undergraduate%20cohort%202023-24)

				- [86.11 *Conditions for Support*](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710528/PACAOS-80) "Particular
				programs and activities of a Registered Campus Organization funded from compulsory
				campus-based student fees shall be open to participation by the entire campus
				community."

	3. UCLA "expects" students to function autonomously using value systems in place

		- photo of the statue 

			- considered discrimination based on the above definition

		- [Mary Osako statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/campus-condemns-antisemitic-caricature-at-uc-regents-meeting)

			- True Bruin Values

			- Principles of community

	4. "Student safety" is a concern because the campus is open to the public

		- [UCLA is a land-grant institution](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa/how-we-work/partnerships/land-grant-colleges-universities)

		- [This makes UCLA open-access](https://dailybruin.com/2024/01/29/uclas-open-campus-raises-questions-around-student-safety)

- How does UCLA policy and enforcement support the above? Where there is a lack of systems, what patterns have emerged? 

	- Policies, reporting, consequences

		- Student misconduct 

			- There are [systems](https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/individual-student-code) in place and information is [available](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/student-conduct-faq) wrt conduct and [consequences](https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/2f52f587-8b22-4633-a4f5-d79ee25cea9b)

			- Effectively none of this matters, because if a student is reported, an [administrative hold](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1d4iy65/ucla_threatens_to_withhold_degrees_from/) is placed on their myUCLA account to force engagement 

		- Group misconduct 

			- Similar systems are in place for [group](https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/group-student-code) misconduct 

				- Section II. Definitions, Section K, *Student Group*

					- *USAC* 

				- Section III.B, *Types of Misconduct* includes 202.11, *Discrimination and Harassment*

					- 202.11a *Discrimination*

					- 202.11b *Harassment*

	- "Weak" handling

		- Acknowledgement by Jewish groups that antisemitism exists on campus

			- Grant---[*LA Campuses United Against Antisemitism*](https://www.jewishfoundationla.org/grant/la-campuses-united-against-antisemitism/) 

			- [Campus Impact Network (CIN)](https://www.jewishla.org/the-jewish-federation-of-greater-los-angeles-launches-campus-impact-network-to-address-antisemitism-on-college-campuses/) 

			- [Antisemitic display](https://jewishjournal.com/community/369554/ucla-condemns-ugly-antisemitic-pig-display/) was a catalyst for discussion about ongoing issues with antisemitism on campus 

		- Osako said "The protest has ended and the display has been removed." 

			- The distinction between protected and unprotected speech should be well understood by the administration and students alike

			- What is depicted in the display shows clear discrimination (by the above definitions)

			- Why did they wait for the protest to be over before removing it? 

		- Incidents occurring on Nov 7th & 8th 

			- Nov 7th 

			- Nov 8th rally in support of Palestine

				- Students went viral for screaming hate speech

			- [Block and Drake respond](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california)

				- [Policy measures](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-michael-v-drake-md-opening-remarks-november-15-regents-meeting) function as symbolic gestures

				- No accountability efforts

					- Zero acknowledgement of non-affiliate problem

					- No compulsory incident reviews with persons involved

	- Vague promises of investigations and punishment 

		- [Non-affiliate policy](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs#:~:text=No%20non%2Daffiliate%20shall%20solicit,profit%20or%20otherwise%2C%20except%20as)

		- Incident of [aggressive harassment](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTYyrwrue7/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=da38a384-7a44-4f57-8bd6-b2b95de70ae8) (IG post 10-12)

		- UCLA spokesperson [addresses the incident](https://dailybruin.com/2023/10/26/hundreds-of-ucla-students-participate-in-march-walkout-for-palestine) (Daily Bruin 10-27) at an event

			- This needs a follow-up inquiry, doubtful there is any info on it that is publicly available

		- There was *no statement made* by the UCLA administration or Gene Block

			- Block made a general statement about the Gaza conflict on 10-13

			- No statement is an act of condemnation of the students in and of itself 

			- Yet another exercise in the conflating of protected and unprotected student activity 

			- Only* Hillel [addressed the issue](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyT4RrxPNJU/?img_index=2) specifically (10-12)

	- Complete inaction with respect to organizational activity

		- Background and context

			- Establish the position of these organizations 

				- Protected activity

					- Qualification of this speech as abhorrent or not is irrelevant, it is protected 

					- They dispute the statehood of Israel

						- The broader picture shows more than interest in ending the Gaza conflict, or ending "occupation"

						- They use several mechanisms to undermine Israel's legitimacy 

		- Unprotected activity

		- Student grievances 
		
	- Events, rallies, and Demonstration handling faces criticism 

		- [Article](https://dailybruin.com/2023/12/05/ucla-faces-scrutiny-for-safety-issues-at-protests-for-israel-palestine) by the Bruin---*UCLA faces scrutiny for safety issues at protests for Israel, Palestine (12-5)*  

			- covers issues of slow responses from UCLA administration liaisons, security failure issues and imbalanced policing

			- "university does not restrict or control the views shared by student groups.‚Äù

				- this is their "blanket statement" that reserves them the right not to get involved even when discrimination and harassment are occurring 

	- Consequences

		- The implications of a failure to acknowledge emerging patterns
		
			- A toxic campus environment for Jewish students 

			- An unsafe campus environment for pro-Palestinian students
