- The response was a massive clusterfuck of miscommunication especially in the days leading up to April 30th

	- Ad hoc, it really seemed like they had zero experience handling this situation 

	- No planning between UCPD and administration 

	- Misapplication of the Safety Plan, due to misunderstanding of the state of campus

- Then on April 30th 

	- Seems like here there was more deliberate negligence 

		- Started realizing things were unsafe

		- Communication was bad despite this knowledge

			- It was bad between Thomas and Administration 

			- It was bad between Administration and students 

- The details

	- Strategic direction 

		- UC Community Safety Plan

	- Crowd control and protest management

		- What level of commitment did UCLA have to the Robinson Edley Report?

	- UC systemwide response team hasn't been trained since 2020

		- What role did they have in the encampment clearing days later in the middle of the night? 

	- June 10th

		- What does the policy manual say about their use of force policy
