- It is very convenient for the school to support 1st amendment rights in the manner that it is---doing nothing. The school can uphold the 1st amendment in a way that is legal, which would take significantly more involvement and oversight. They would need to be more than "just a bank that holds classes sometimes" or whatever that students said

	- It is clear this is happening because even in areas where they were tasked with implementing policy, they failed to do so and simply threw money at the problem after disaster struck


### Non-affiliates are harassing students

- Whether it be by student conduct, non-affiliate conduct, Title VI, or the 1st amendment we know that

	- Physical harassment that occurred is not protected by any of the above 

	- The school is showing a willful indifference to this form of harassment

	- The school is not approaching policing in a balanced fashion

		- the school is knowingly allowing harassment to occur

		- in the case of the protesters, they get a dispersal order, if they do not disperse, then they are cited (two instances where they were either caught off guard or kettled)

			- The students were collateral damage, the students were purposefully punished before graduation, and they were kept from their own graduation (cite peaceful protest statistics)

		- The counter protesters were allowed to disperse without any citation

			- The counter-protesters effectively engaged in conduct so severe, it denied students access to their education, because they were injured. This warrants a no-contact order for all who engaged in this conduct. 

			- Even though they should have faced criminal and misdemeanor charges by [SECTION 100013](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs) and should be subject to no-contact orders by [Anti-Discrimination](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/1001004/Anti-Discrimination) policy or some other on-campus conduct policy

		- By both the Policies, Principles and Practices 2024 update and the Robinson/Edley report, UCLA should have had a protocol in place for when non-affiliate harassment happens. They should also have a formal protest monitoring system that includes video for accountability purposes. 

			- The 2024 report says it leaves policy regarding protests largely to individual campuses because each campus is unique in its circumstances

			- It is time for UCLA to revise its non-affiliate policy

- It doesn't matter whether Thomas had sufficient forces present in case violence breaks out. The issue 
is "operational execution" (UCPD) versus "strategic direction" (UC administration). The policy 
*does not matter* if it is not enforced. Part of this strategy requires preventative measures such
 as behavior deterrents via condemnation. Otherwise the reactive mechanism is necessary- cite people 
 for harassment. 

- In the days leading up to the violence, UCLA needed to recognize that acts of aggression were 
one-sided. Whether a strong police presence was eventually necessary or not, they should have started 
citing for harassment days before April 30th. If they had put their own non-affiliate policy to use by 
citing people for harassment and threatened criminal arrest if violence breaks out, the outbreak in 
violence would never have happened. But even if one could say they wanted to allow the "civil discourse" 
to remain organic and who could have known it would blow up the way it did... Then hypothetically, the 
moment things began to get out of hand on April 30th, had sufficient police been on the scene, what was 
the strategic plan for the counter-protesters? It is likely the outcome would have been to issue 
dispersal orders. Then what conduct exactly warrants consequences for non-affiliates? Regardless of 
finger pointing, it isn't about safety, although that is the first priority. The issue is the rights 
of these students *to free speech* and to *access their education* are not being protected by the 
university. Because there is no mechanism in place to protect them in the event an incident occurs. 
If assailants fleed the scene too quickly to be arrested, and police focused on crowd control for safety 
purposes. Where is the position on the University making clear the consequences for the *harassment* of 
students?

- The response was a massive clusterfuck of miscommunication especially in the days leading up to April 30th

	- Ad hoc, it really seemed like they had zero experience handling this situation 

	- No planning between UCPD and administration 

	- Misapplication of the Safety Plan, due to misunderstanding of the state of campus

- Then on April 30th 

	- Seems like here there was more deliberate negligence 

		- Started realizing things were unsafe

		- Communication was bad despite this knowledge

			- It was bad between Thomas and Administration 

			- It was bad between Administration and students 

- The details

	- Strategic direction 

		- UC Community Safety Plan

	- Crowd control and protest management

		- What level of commitment did UCLA have to the Robinson Edley Report?

	- UC systemwide response team hasn't been trained since 2020

		- What role did they have in the encampment clearing days later in the middle of the night? 

	- June 10th

		- What does the policy manual say about their use of force policy
