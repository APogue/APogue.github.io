- [Robinson/Edley Report](https://campusprotestreport.universityofcalifornia.edu/documents/implementation-report.pdf)

	- A lot of policy that seems very effective. Without dedicated accountability policy, schools will take the "path of least resistance" to achieve an end, bypassing all preordained policy for force, oppression, and the chilling of free speech. 

	- Unlike the other schools, UCLA gave the impression they had all necessary systems in place. There was mention of training and an "Incident Command System" they were pursuing at the time. I can't find any "Incident Command System" associated with UCLA. 

- [Principles, Policies, and Practices: A toolkit to prepare for and manage major campus events or incidents](https://diversity.universityofcalifornia.edu/files/uc-major-events-toolkit-2024-update-003.pdf)

	- 2024 policy doc still relies on Robinson/Edley Report for protest management

	- Gets very specific on UC position on free speech

		- "Regardless of whether one has a legal right to speak in a manner that reflects bias,
	stereotypes, prejudice and intolerance, each member of the University community is
	expected to consider his or her responsibilities as well as his or her rights.
	Intellectual and creative expression that is intended to shock has a place in our
	community. Nevertheless, mutual respect and civility within debate and dialogue
	advance the mission of the University, advance each of us as learners and teachers,
	and advance a democratic society"

	- It also makes clear that while exceptions to the 1st Amendment are narrowly defined, students are subject to student conduct policy, and can be disciplined. This presents a double standard, where students are subject to rules and the non-affiliates are not. 

	- [Regulations Governing Conduct of Non-Affiliates in the Buildings and on the Grounds of the University of California](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs) there is no mention of harassment in this doc

	- Later in the doc it mentions [Free Speech on Campus: The Basics, The Myths, The Challenges](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/free-speech-on-campus)

		- Why were all the red triangles removed without any acknowledgment one way or the other? Are they an expression of free speech? Then don't remove them. Are they discrimination? Then why hide this fact? If the university is a place where truth prevails, and it must exist entirely unmoderated and unprocessed, why sanitize the movement? Especially when censorship in this case can be used as a teachable moment. 

		-  defamation (false statements of fact published with a particularly reckless state of
		mind that harms reputation) and harassment (sexual, racial, etc) are categorical exceptions to free speech

		- "The following pages offer a point of departure for this journey. This isn’t legal advice. It’s not even meant as official University policy. It’s instead the start of a public conversation. Our analysis is incomplete, a work-in-progress, consistent with the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion’s ethos that embraces reflection, revision, and reiteration."

		- "Does the First Amendment apply to UCLA? Yes, because as an extension of the California government, UCLA is a state actor. So, if UCLA constrains your freedom of speech, then the First Amendment most definitely applies."

		- "Of course, UCLA should do everything possible to ensure that those disagreements are debated on-the-merits, with clarifications, concessions, persuasion, and respect. But the bottom line is that we want that diversity of viewpoints to be aired, debated, and considered, not trapped inside single-minded echo chambers."

		- "The freedom to communicate (speech) and the (academic) freedom to inquire are both essential to the university’s fundamental mission, “which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it to its students and to society at large.”"

		- "But as a descriptive statement of law, the assertion “hate speech is not free speech” is just plain wrong. The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws—including university “speech codes”— that penalize or otherwise regulate “hate speech.”"

		- "Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as “unprotected speech” and “less protected speech” narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future."

		- They understand and acknowledge that truth does not always prevail in the marketplace of ideas

		- "Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment...But this means freedom of speech can sometimes be constrained to further the right to equality. The reality—and challenge—is that sometimes equality gives way to freedom of speech, and vice versa."

		- "And most important, what counts as “harassment?” Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as “unprotected speech” and “less protected speech” narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future."

		- "Remember that certain forms of speech, such as true threats and defamation, are unprotected under the First Amendment. There’s a reason why these forms of speech are unprotected (or less protected); as a general rule, it’s understood that they cause concrete harm and provide little if any social value. UCLA is largely free to regulate those forms of speech and it should attempt to do so."

		- "UCLA Student Conduct Code (Section 102.11) defines harassment as “conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so substantially impairs a person’s access to University programs or activities that the person is effectively denied equal access to the University’s resources and opportunities.”"
	
		- "That amounts to a “Heckler’s Veto,” which the University frowns upon and First Amendment law does not protect."

		- "Even though UCLA as “sovereign” cannot suppress speech simply because it disagrees with its message, UCLA as “speaker” may pick a side and share its beliefs. UCLA can, and should, exercise the full power of its bully pulpit to speak our values...This includes publicly denouncing hate speech, whether that speech is expressed by members of the UCLA community or by those invited into our fold."

		- "Geat ideas, great art, and great teaching should often make us uncomfortable."

		- "In addition, UCLA should continue its efforts to diversify the university; to facilitate the development of programmatic and curricular initiatives that advance and reflect its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion; and proactively work to ensure that no student feels barred from participating in the multiple dimensions of campus life because of their social group membership."


- It is very convenient for the school to support 1st amendment rights in the manner that it is---doing nothing. The school can uphold the 1st amendment in a way that is legal, which would take significantly more involvement and oversight. They would need to be more than "just a bank that holds classes sometimes" or whatever that students said

	- It is clear this is happening because even in areas where they were tasked with implementing policy, they failed to do so and simply threw money at the problem after disaster struck

- [Campus safety report 2022](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/Public-Safety-Report), not sure if this is related to the above



- The response was a massive clusterfuck of miscommunication especially in the days leading up to April 30th

	- Ad hoc, it really seemed like they had zero experience handling this situation 

	- No planning between UCPD and administration 

	- Misapplication of the Safety Plan, due to misunderstanding of the state of campus

- Then on April 30th 

	- Seems like here there was more deliberate negligence 

		- Started realizing things were unsafe

		- Communication was bad despite this knowledge

			- It was bad between Thomas and Administration 

			- It was bad between Administration and students 

- The details

	- Strategic direction 

		- UC Community Safety Plan

	- Crowd control and protest management

		- What level of commitment did UCLA have to the Robinson Edley Report?

	- UC systemwide response team hasn't been trained since 2020

		- What role did they have in the encampment clearing days later in the middle of the night? 

	- June 10th

		- What does the policy manual say about their use of force policy
