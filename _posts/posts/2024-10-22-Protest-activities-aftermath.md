Thesis3: It was implied that the Office of Campus Safety was put in place out of concern for student safety, and as an "olive branch" to those who thought UCLA put students in danger during the April protest.

Thesis4: The Office of Campus Safety has served to "maintain order." 

Thesis5: Administrative actions meant to safeguard free speech---no interference or oversight, heavy policing targeting students---looks like their strategic plan. This plan is inconsistent with existing policy and data, and only serves to chill free speech---UCLA is cannabalizing its own mission. 



### Robinson/Edley report

- Brought up in the 2024 UC toolkit

- Statistics from DB and policy reports on UCLA protests being largely peaceful 

- What's the point of this beautifully thought out policy that administrators signed their commitment to, if when push comes to shove they take the path of least resistance and all of a sudden it's Texas in California. 

- Administrators *need* to back up everything they do with policy. Not "we are heartbroken," again giving 2004 kind of response to events and incidents that can affect hundreds of students. Everything must come from study, data, and training on the subject. Nothing of large magnitude affecting hundreds of students can be dealt with by administrative "parenting" or instinct. 

### Directly relevant UC policies 

- No masking

- No encampments 

- LA Times article on spending 

- What the Regents Chair said about "safety"

- Regents resolution on distancing from polemic messaging (did that get approved?)

- Heavy policing is a UC standard 

	- UC Divest Protest to Regents meeting

		- Many officers present


### UCLA graduation 

- dates of commencement 

### Mayor Bass said

### Rick Braziel said in the Daily Bruin 

- [UCLA spends millions on pro-Palestine protests, considers attendants to fund costs](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/24/ucla-spends-millions-on-pro-palestine-protests-considers-attendants-to-fund-costs), July 24th

	- “Rick Braziel, associate vice chancellor for the Office of Campus Safety, said an issue the university ran into with its law enforcement for the spring protests is that they did not anticipate every scenario that could happen and plan the appropriate responses. He added that the hasty response time required for the protests made it so the university was “scrambling” to find law enforcement, hiring people at a rate that could have been lower with ample preparation.”

### Rick Braziel LA Times interview

- No office of campus safety

- He was hired temporarily 

- Still no report on April 30th

- His position was just extended

	- Paid a huge bloated salary

- More militarization, more security

- DB on Oct 7th? Did counter-protesters show up?





### Arrests

- [USAC officers announce additional arrests, warrants related to encampment attack](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/18/usac-officers-announce-additional-arrests-warrants-related-to-encampment-attack)

	- "The report said two individuals have been arrested on felony charges with primary hearings scheduled, and two more individuals have active warrants for arrest – one with a felony warrant and one with a misdemeanor warrant. The report also said there is one additional case being reviewed by United States Attorney for the Central District of California E. Martin Estrada’s office."

	- "One of the individuals with felony charges was Eyal Shalom – who was coined by several accounts as “#UCLAMaroonHoodie” on X, formerly Twitter. Shalom was arrested for illegal use of tear gas May 1. Journalist Dolores Quintana took to X in May saying Shalom pepper sprayed her in the eye, while another man shone a light on her face." 

	- [Eyal Shalom sprays journalist directly in the face](https://x.com/doloresquintana/status/1794899214734184806) (video evidence)

	- [CNN identified Eden On and Marlan-Librett](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html)---

		- "The other individual arrested with felony charges, Malachi Joshua Marlan-Librett, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon – not firearm – as well as special circumstance allegations of a hate crime and a use of a deadly weapon from May 1. Marlan-Librett, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2020, was also charged with two felony counts of battery from April 28. 

		Marlan-Librett – who was first identified by CNN as an April 30 attacker in May – is set to have a preliminary hearing Nov. 22 at Airport Courthouse."

		- Eyal Shalom is also pictured in the CNN report

	- "As of now, two individuals have been arrested on felony charges, and their primary hearings have been scheduled. Additionally, two more individuals have active warrants being processed by the District Attorney's office. One individual has a felony warrant issued, while another, initially charged with a felony, had their charged reclassified as a misdemeanor by the judge. Lastly there is one case currently being reviewed by the US Attorneys Office."

	- The reclassified individual is likely Edan On (below)

### Irvine chancellor

- He reaches out directly to the encampment

- It seemed with UCLA they were communicating through the Daily Bruin, the People's Council or some other 3rd party channel

- That is incredibly unsafe not to try to interact with them directly 


### Effects of imbalanced handling (thought notes)

- The conflating of protected and unprotected activity is always in service of the negative handling of pro-Palestinian students

- There is a pattern showing a lack of siding with pro-Palestinian protesters via punishment, statement omissions, or a negative administrative tone

- Ignoring instances of clear discrimination as part of a broader construct set up in the disservice of this group of students

- It is fueling the flames of divide between student groups

- Not truly committed to content-neutral student management

- Not truly committed to a legal, free speech environment
