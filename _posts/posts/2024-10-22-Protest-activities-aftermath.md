Thesis1: The biased handling of protesters by the administration continues in the aftermath of the April Riot. 

Thesis2: When things got completely out of hand, even after police arrived they did nothing; proving at the very least there was no strategic plan in place.

Thesis3: It was implied that the Office of Campus Safety was put in place out of concern for student safety, and as an "olive branch" to those who thought UCLA put students in danger during the April protest.

Thesis4: The Office of Campus Safety has served to "maintain order." Without any acknowledgment or admission that non-affiliates acted as chaos agents in past protests they attended, UCLA has pointed the gun at students, patting themselves on the back when protest activities "go off without a hitch."

Thesis5: Administrative actions meant to safeguard free speech---no interference or oversight, heavy policing targeting students---looks like their strategic plan. This plan is inconsistent with existing policy and data, and only serves to chill free speech---UCLA is cannabalizing its own mission. 



### Robinson/Edley report

- Brought up in the 2024 UC toolkit

- Statistics from DB and policy reports on UCLA protests being largely peaceful 

- What's the point of this beautifully thought out policy that administrators signed their commitment to, if when push comes to shove they take the path of least resistance and all of a sudden it's Texas in California. 

- Administrators *need* to back up everything they do with policy. Not "we are heartbroken," again giving 2004 kind of response to events and incidents that can affect hundreds of students. Everything must come from study, data, and training on the subject. Nothing of large magnitude affecting hundreds of students can be dealt with by administrative "parenting" or instinct.

### Protests around the time that Ben Shapiro came to speak for Young Americans for Freedom and or aligning with Sukkot 

- [Ben Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO7iLqeXcks&ab_channel=YoungAmerica%27sFoundation) had a talk at around 6:30 PM on 10-21

	- Would things be different if they went to the SE corner of Dickson Court? [Map](https://ucla.app.box.com/s/f96iffe5u6p2azrr54gug0zlt85a24zf?&utm_source=1486242611&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=BruinPost&utm_content=public-expression), any kind encampment is no longer consistent with "manner" policy

	- "In observance of the holiday of Sukkot, Jewish students at UCLA erected a Gaza Solidarity Sukkah. They adorned the Sukkah with handmade decorations, photos of anti-Zionist Jewish ancestors, and banners that read “Stop Arming Israel.” They were joined by other students of conscience, members of Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, who gathered to join in prayer and protest.

	Then, pro-genocide agitators and UCLA administrators tore their Sukkah down.

	First, agitators surrounded the Sukkah and taunted the students with slurs and threats. Then, police in riot gear then arrived to clear the area, allowing agitators to begin tearing down handmade decorations. Finally, facilities workers sent by UCLA admin completed the destruction of this sacred dwelling.

	In keeping with Jewish tradition, students intended to eat and sleep in the Sukkah—a ritual in remembrance of Jewish ancestors forced to live in temporary structures in the desert while fleeing slavery. This year, students could not separate their observance from the fact that tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to live in temporary shelters due to the Israeli military's mass destruction of homes in Gaza. Jewish students across the country are observing Sukkot by erecting solidarity Sukkahs dedicated to Gaza and to Palestinian liberation.

	As UCLA allowed for the destruction of a sacred Jewish religious structure, the truth was clear: the University does not care about actual experiences of antisemitism—only about how it can use concerns about the “safety” of Jewish students to suppress anyone who dares to speak out for Palestine.

	Over the past months, UCLA has chosen to further militarize the campus and criminalize speech and political activity instead of withdrawing its support for Israeli human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
	Despite threats from pro-genocide agitators and from UCLA police, students of conscience at UCLA remain committed to calling on their university to divest from the Israeli military which is destroying life in Gaza."---Was the encampment deemed "unsafe?" Or was it interfering with operations? What is the Robinson/Edley policy on civil disobedience? What does the ACLU lawsuit say about negotiating with a protest? (There's policy on it). The encampments are "unsafe" because they attract harassers.

		- These were completely peaceful circumstances

		- There have been no comments from Braziel, the Chancellor, or Osako

- [Daily Bruin up-to-min coverage](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/21/live-graduate-students-for-justice-in-palestine-demonstration)

	- "8:12 p.m.---Around 30 counter-protesters arrived in Dickson Court North and began to heckle pro-Palestine protesters. In response, pro-Palestine protesters attempted to form a line to prevent them from accessing the sukkah."

	- The arrested was referred to as a "demonstrator," is presumed a pro-Palestinian demonstrator

	- "3:05 p.m. – Chabad at UCLA and Alpha Epsilon Pi also set up a sukkah in Bruin Plaza on Monday morning. A fire marshal from UCFD did not respond to a request for comment as to whether that temporary structure is a fire hazard – which UCFD declared the sukkah in Dickson Court North to be."

		- Bruin Plaza is an approved area for public expression, not sure how that relates to fire code, but the Sukkahs were on the wrong side of Dickson Court

- [Braziel's handling of Oct 7](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-11/intense-ucla-policing-draws-scrutiny-as-security-chief-speaks-out-on-protests)

	- “He declined to comment on why no university action was taken against pro-Palestinian students who refused to comply with protest rules on approved free speech zones and amplified-sound restrictions. He said police did not arrest anyone because protesters were not significantly disrupting campus operations, the trigger to declare an unlawful assembly and cite them if they refuse to leave.”

	- The question becomes, if the Sukkahs are peaceful civil disobedience, that should be allowed if not disrupting campus operations, then what was disrupting operations? The counter-protesters that the Sukkahs attracted? 




### Arrests

- [USAC officers announce additional arrests, warrants related to encampment attack](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/18/usac-officers-announce-additional-arrests-warrants-related-to-encampment-attack)

	- "The report said two individuals have been arrested on felony charges with primary hearings scheduled, and two more individuals have active warrants for arrest – one with a felony warrant and one with a misdemeanor warrant. The report also said there is one additional case being reviewed by United States Attorney for the Central District of California E. Martin Estrada’s office."

	- "One of the individuals with felony charges was Eyal Shalom – who was coined by several accounts as “#UCLAMaroonHoodie” on X, formerly Twitter. Shalom was arrested for illegal use of tear gas May 1. Journalist Dolores Quintana took to X in May saying Shalom pepper sprayed her in the eye, while another man shone a light on her face." 

	- [Eyal Shalom sprays journalist directly in the face](https://x.com/doloresquintana/status/1794899214734184806) (video evidence)

	- [CNN identified Eden On and Marlan-Librett](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html)---

		- "The other individual arrested with felony charges, Malachi Joshua Marlan-Librett, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon – not firearm – as well as special circumstance allegations of a hate crime and a use of a deadly weapon from May 1. Marlan-Librett, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2020, was also charged with two felony counts of battery from April 28. 

		Marlan-Librett – who was first identified by CNN as an April 30 attacker in May – is set to have a preliminary hearing Nov. 22 at Airport Courthouse."

		- Eyal Shalom is also pictured in the CNN report

	- "As of now, two individuals have been arrested on felony charges, and their primary hearings have been scheduled. Additionally, two more individuals have active warrants being processed by the District Attorney's office. One individual has a felony warrant issued, while another, initially charged with a felony, had their charged reclassified as a misdemeanor by the judge. Lastly there is one case currently being reviewed by the US Attorneys Office."

	- The reclassified individual is likely Edan On (below)

### Effects of imbalanced handling (thought notes)

- The conflating of protected and unprotected activity is always in service of the negative handling of pro-Palestinian students

- There is a pattern showing a lack of siding with pro-Palestinian protesters via punishment, statement omissions, or a negative administrative tone

- Ignoring instances of clear discrimination as part of a broader construct set up in the disservice of this group of students

- It is fueling the flames of divide between student groups

- Not truly committed to content-neutral student management

- Not truly committed to a legal, free speech environment
