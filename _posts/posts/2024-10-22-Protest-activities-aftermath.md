Thesis3: It was implied that the Office of Campus Safety was put in place out of concern for student safety, and as an "olive branch" to those who thought UCLA put students in danger during the April protest.

Thesis4: The Office of Campus Safety has served to "maintain order." 

Thesis5: Administrative actions meant to safeguard free speech---no interference or oversight, heavy policing targeting students---looks like their strategic plan. This plan is inconsistent with existing policy and data, and only serves to chill free speech---UCLA is cannabalizing its own mission. 



### Robinson/Edley report

- Brought up in the 2024 UC toolkit

- Statistics from DB and policy reports on UCLA protests being largely peaceful 

- What's the point of this beautifully thought out policy that administrators signed their commitment to, if when push comes to shove they take the path of least resistance and all of a sudden it's Texas in California. 

- Administrators *need* to back up everything they do with policy. Not "we are heartbroken," again giving 2004 kind of response to events and incidents that can affect hundreds of students. Everything must come from study, data, and training on the subject. Nothing of large magnitude affecting hundreds of students can be dealt with by administrative "parenting" or instinct. 

### Directly relevant UC policies 

- No masking

- No encampments 

- LA Times article on spending 

- What the Regents Chair said about "safety"

- Regents resolution on distancing from polemic messaging (did that get approved?)

- Heavy policing is a UC standard 

	- UC Divest Protest to Regents meeting

		- Many officers present

### Mayor Bass said

### Block messages in the days after 

- [Chancellor Block shared the following message with the UCLA campus community](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/changes-to-campus-security-operations/), May 5, 2024

	- "Protecting the safety of our community underpins everything we do at UCLA. Our students, faculty and staff can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure.

		In the past week, our campus has been shaken by events that have disturbed this sense of safety and strained trust within our community. In light of this, both UCLA and the UC Office of the President have committed to a thorough investigation of our security processes. But one thing is already clear: To best protect our community moving forward, urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations."

	- "Effective immediately, I am moving oversight and management of UCLA PD and the Office of Emergency Management from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to a newly created Office of Campus Safety, whose leader reports directly to me. It is clear that UCLA needs a unit and leader whose sole responsibility is campus safety to guide us through tense times. This organizational structure, which elevates our safety and emergency management operations, has proven to be an effective one at other major universities across the country.

		Leading the Office of Campus Safety as its inaugural associate vice chancellor is Rick Braziel, who brings to the position more than 30 years of public safety service, including five years as chief of police for the City of Sacramento. Braziel has also served as an instructor in community policing and has led reviews of law enforcement agencies and police responses."

	- "The well-being of our students, faculty and staff is paramount. These actions are essential for creating a secure environment where everyone at UCLA can confidently pursue their studies and careers."

### Rick Braziel said in the Daily Bruin 

- [UCLA spends millions on pro-Palestine protests, considers attendants to fund costs](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/24/ucla-spends-millions-on-pro-palestine-protests-considers-attendants-to-fund-costs), July 24th

	- “Rick Braziel, associate vice chancellor for the Office of Campus Safety, said an issue the university ran into with its law enforcement for the spring protests is that they did not anticipate every scenario that could happen and plan the appropriate responses. He added that the hasty response time required for the protests made it so the university was “scrambling” to find law enforcement, hiring people at a rate that could have been lower with ample preparation.”

### Rick Braziel LA Times interview

- [Intense UCLA policing draws scrutiny as security chief speaks out on handling protests](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-11/intense-ucla-policing-draws-scrutiny-as-security-chief-speaks-out-on-protests)

- The truth about his "role" at UCLA

	- “In an interview with The Times, Braziel laid out his strategy for overhauling UCLA security operations — and responded to questions and criticism from faculty and others about his role, which is actually a $52,000-a-month short-term position.”

	- "Ariela Gross, a UCLA law professor, was one of several who expressed concern about accountability as Braziel was hired so quickly into such a senior position to start a new administrative office without faculty input — as is generally required under UC’s system of shared governance."

	- "But Braziel’s terms of employment are significantly different from public assumptions, based on Block’s announcement. He is not a permanent employee with multiple responsibilities related to campus safety. Braziel’s original contract, obtained by The Times, ended Aug. 31 and has been extended until the end of the year."

	- "He said he hoped to have key changes in place with a plan to move forward to hand off to the incoming chancellor, Julio Frenk, who will take the reins Jan. 1."

	- "He said he agreed to a short-term contract to review UCLA’s protest management and suggest institutional changes to improve safety practices after first being contacted by the UC Office of the President and then Block."

	- "He said he understood his other job duties as helping UCLA through a peaceful commencement, and providing updates on security operations to Block, who testified before a congressional committee in May about campus efforts to combat antisemitism and manage protests. Block stepped down July 31."

	- "“I’m the person coming in for just a few months, hopefully fix things, get them moving down the road and then somebody else takes over when I’m gone,” he said."

	- "Braziel said he never agreed to set up the new Office of Campus Safety or prepare a campus response plan for potential fall protests — tasks that each amount to full-time jobs themselves but that many expected him to take on. Creating the safety office, he said, would take several employees many months to create a website, complaint intake process, training curriculum, policies and procedures, compliance auditing, staffing and planning for such future events as the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles."

		- What about the investigation on April 30th? Where is it? 

	- "Braziel said he was given no staff or funding for either job but agreed to extend his contract after receiving approval to hire consultants to do them."

	- "The violence of the melee and encampment takedown was predictable, he said, looking at what was happening at Columbia University and other protest hot spots at the time — but UCLA was operating in reactive mode."

	- "“We have to stop playing checkers where you’re waiting for something to happen and respond,” he said. “With chess, you’re constantly looking four, five moves down the board to anticipate what will happen so you can either avoid it or better respond to it.”"


### Arrests

- [USAC officers announce additional arrests, warrants related to encampment attack](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/18/usac-officers-announce-additional-arrests-warrants-related-to-encampment-attack)

	- "The report said two individuals have been arrested on felony charges with primary hearings scheduled, and two more individuals have active warrants for arrest – one with a felony warrant and one with a misdemeanor warrant. The report also said there is one additional case being reviewed by United States Attorney for the Central District of California E. Martin Estrada’s office."

	- "One of the individuals with felony charges was Eyal Shalom – who was coined by several accounts as “#UCLAMaroonHoodie” on X, formerly Twitter. Shalom was arrested for illegal use of tear gas May 1. Journalist Dolores Quintana took to X in May saying Shalom pepper sprayed her in the eye, while another man shone a light on her face." 

	- [Eyal Shalom sprays journalist directly in the face](https://x.com/doloresquintana/status/1794899214734184806) (video evidence)

	- [CNN identified Eden On and Marlan-Librett](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html)---

		- "The other individual arrested with felony charges, Malachi Joshua Marlan-Librett, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon – not firearm – as well as special circumstance allegations of a hate crime and a use of a deadly weapon from May 1. Marlan-Librett, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2020, was also charged with two felony counts of battery from April 28. 

		Marlan-Librett – who was first identified by CNN as an April 30 attacker in May – is set to have a preliminary hearing Nov. 22 at Airport Courthouse."

		- Eyal Shalom is also pictured in the CNN report

	- "As of now, two individuals have been arrested on felony charges, and their primary hearings have been scheduled. Additionally, two more individuals have active warrants being processed by the District Attorney's office. One individual has a felony warrant issued, while another, initially charged with a felony, had their charged reclassified as a misdemeanor by the judge. Lastly there is one case currently being reviewed by the US Attorneys Office."

	- The reclassified individual is likely Edan On (below)

### Irvine chancellor

- He reaches out directly to the encampment

- It seemed with UCLA they were communicating through the Daily Bruin, the People's Council or some other 3rd party channel

- That is incredibly unsafe not to try to interact with them directly 


### Effects of imbalanced handling (thought notes)

- The conflating of protected and unprotected activity is always in service of the negative handling of pro-Palestinian students

- There is a pattern showing a lack of siding with pro-Palestinian protesters via punishment, statement omissions, or a negative administrative tone

- Ignoring instances of clear discrimination as part of a broader construct set up in the disservice of this group of students

- It is fueling the flames of divide between student groups

- Not truly committed to content-neutral student management

- Not truly committed to a legal, free speech environment
