###  Title IX is a working model for Title VI 

- We have all felt protected by Title IX

	- The entire UCLA community receives Title IX education annually 

		- [Training required annually](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/education-training/undergraduate-students), failure to complete training results in registration hold on account 

- Who do we have to thank for this? 

	- [Training requirements](https://equity.ucla.edu/education/mandatory-trainings/t9-sexual-violence-sexual-harassment-training/#student) and relevant policies 

### Title IX and Title VI definitions (chronological)

- This is the definition of Title VI

- This is the definition of Title IX

### Administrative Enforcement of Title IX and Title VI

- There is a discrepancy with respect to how they're enforced

- They key to Title IX is

	- Notification of rights

	- Competency with respect to these rights 

	- Having knowledge of who to report to 

	- A Title IX Coordinator to ensure compliance 

		- Why are they important? 

	- Campus SaVE Act goes farther, requiring periodic reporting

- Title VI designed by the "recipient" 

	- Notification of rights do not go as far

	- Optional training (freshman orientation)

	- Confusing reporting mechanism

	- No legal obligation to respond to reports 


### The Civil Rights Protection Mechanism 

- As indicated by the above, Title IX goes farther than Title VI, it has made incredible progress

	- Student safety was the main driver of progress 

	- Student safety is now a major concern with respect to Title VI

		- Training is a large part of that progress

		- Why Title IX training (theoretically) works 

			- Competency with respect to rights

			- The training ranges from social awareness and de-escalation to behavioral aid in a potentially unsafe situation 

				- "shelly is struggling in school, you talk to her and it seems shes upset about..."

### There is still a need for progress 

- The original purpose for Title IX went beyond student safety

- History of Title IX 

- Proves that in essence, these are similar civil rights protections to Title VI

- Given these acts were created to broaden access to education, there needs to be progress here as well	

#### The case for education 

- Inadequate Title IX and Title VI protections require attention 

	- Based on the last year, it is impossible to say that the current standard for Title VI is working, we know that with respect to antisemitic and anti-Muslim activity

	- Based on these issues why would we assume it is working at all? 

	- The "protection mechanism"

		- Is the law vague with respect to what constitutes "protection of rights?"

		- Discrepancies in notification 

			- Title IX rights are made available to every student, by law

			- Title VI is there a legal obligation to make rights available to every student? 

		- If part of the protection mechanism relies on the student then they must be literate with respect to these rights

			- Relevant areas of Title IX beyond SVSH should be covered

			- All or relevant areas of Title VI should be covered

				- UCUES group participation portion as evidence

### Given these shortcomings, can we say civil rights protections are working? Can we say with confidence they are doing what was intended? 

#### The case for a coordinator

- If the law is vague, and its left up to the recipient---who may themselves be the subject of reports---to define "access to education" then that access will inevitably be vulnerable

	- Based on Michigan the schools themselves don't know Title VI 

		- Decentralized reporting with little to no accountability

		- Difficulty deciphering between creation of a hostile environment and protected speech

	- No school has made an effort to identify or willingly admit there are systemic issues 

		- The UC's continue to create offices and blame students 

			- No masking rules 

			- No encampment rules

			- Office of Campus Safety

		- No effort has been made as a matter of safety or accountability to help the students directly 

- UCLA annual data report has inexplicable discrepancies 

	- Civil rights reporting is low compared to Title IX 

- If the number of reports is low, there is no way to determine whether this is due to a functioning system and recipient compliance, or whether this is because the student portion of the feedback cycle is broken 

### UCUES indicates 

- To have a clearer picture on the above...

	- Survey the students, do they know who to report to?

	- Even if the students know who to report to, do they know when to report if they don't properly understand their rights? 

- The UCUES survey indicates

	- Students do not know who to report to

- Problems with UCUES

	- UCUES is optional 

	- UCUES is massive 

	- UCUES made certain civil rights questions optional, in an optional survey 

### What the students need 

- Campus SaVE took a Dear Colleague letter and made it into law

- The number of cases pending and the time it takes to conduct investigations across post-secondary institutions is a problem

- How much damage has to be done by forcing OCR to continue functioning as a reaction mechanism? 

- Take the Dear Colleague Letters, take the Resolution Letters and Agreements and turn them into law

- Beyond this

	- Model Title VI like Title IX

		- Title VI coordinator

	- Survey the students, separate it from UCUES, and make it mandatory 

		- Do parents want to know that only 75% of their kids know who to report SVSH to? Clearly the answer is no, which is why UCUES made it optional 

- It would also be nice 

	- Accountability reporting

		- Campus climate is a problem in some areas

		- What are the diversity enrollments in STEM?

			- If we don't know, how can we say there's no correlation between minority enrollment and STEM "climate?"

	- More money for DOE and OCR
