###  Title IX is a working model for Title VI 

- We have all felt protected by Title IX

	- The entire UCLA community receives Title IX education annually 

		- [Training required annually](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/education-training/undergraduate-students), failure to complete training results in registration hold on account 

- Who do we have to thank for this? 

	- [Training requirements](https://equity.ucla.edu/education/mandatory-trainings/t9-sexual-violence-sexual-harassment-training/#student) and relevant policies 




### Title IX isn't perfect

- Why Title IX training works 

- But the intention for Title IX was much more than this 

- History of Title IX 

- Proves that in essence, these are similar civil rights protections to Title VI

- These acts were created in the same spirit to broaden access to education 

### Administrative Enforcement of Title IX and Title VI

- Then why is there a discrepancy with respect to how they're enforced? 

- They key to Title IX is

	- Notification of rights

	- Competency with respect to these rights 

	- Having knowledge of who to report to 

	- A Title IX Coordinator to ensure compliance 

		- Why are they important? 

	- Campus SaVE Act goes farther, requiring periodic reporting

- Title VI designed by the "recipient" 

	- Notification of rights do not go as far

	- Optional training (freshman orientation)

	- Confusing reporting mechanism

	- No legal obligation to respond to reports 

### The Civil Rights Protection Mechanism 

- As indicated by the above, Title IX goes farther than Title VI, it has made incredible progress

	- Student safety was the main driver of progress 

	- Student safety is now a major concern with respect to Title VI

- Title IX and Title VI shortcomings require attention 

	- Given these acts were created to broaden access to education, there needs to be progress here as well

	- The "protection mechanism"

		- Discrepancies in notification 

			- Title IX rights are made available to every student, by law

			- Title VI is there a legal obligation to make rights available to every student? 

		- If students are notified but not educated, they can't be part of the "protection feedback cycle"

			- Is the law vague with respect to what constitutes "protection of rights?"

				- If part of that protection mechanism relies on the student then they should be made literate with respect to their rights

					- Relevant areas of Title IX beyond SVSH should be covered

					- All or relevant areas of Title VI should be covered

### Given these shortcomings, can we say civil rights protections are working? Can we say with confidence they are doing what was intended? 
 
- UCLA annual data report has inexplicable discrepancies 

	- Civil rights reporting is low compared to Title IX 

- If the number of reports is low, there is no way to determine whether this is due to a functioning system and recipient compliance, or whether this is because the student portion of the feedback cycle is broken 

- Survey the students, do they know who to report to?

- Even if the students know who to report to, do they know when to report if they don't properly understand their rights? 

### UCUES indicates 

- UCUES is optional 

- UCUES is massive 

- Students do not know who to report to 

- Campus climate is a problem in some areas
