### State policy 

- CA witholding funds

- Laws put in place (Scott Wiener)

	- Is it balanced

	- SJP take, anti-Muslim education is optional (is it?)

### UC policy 

- Drake's policing with safety policy

### UCLA Policy

- UCLA campus safety report 

- UCLA 4 point plan

	- Myers appointed to address campus climate

- What is the point of any of the above if the university doesn't even enforce its own policy on remedial anti-discrimination training

- The UC non-discrimination policy

	- “Training and Education for the Respondent: • If an individual is found to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct under the policy, the respondent may be required to undergo training as a corrective or remedial measure. • The respondent may also need to participate in periodic refresher classes to reinforce appropriate behavior and compliance with anti-discrimination standards.”

	- By the UC anti-discrimination policy, respondents are subject to anti-discrimination training and education. By failing to hold the discriminating persons accountable, they are effectively denying them access to a Title VI education.

- Discrimination that crosses the line opens the door for teachable moments 

	- Forces students to communicate using legal free speech

	- This will aid in becoming more effective communicators after college

	- It also opens the forum for civil discourse---a more meaningful use of time and resources 

	- Denying them anti-discrimination education means they do not care about these individuals and they do not care about campus climate. 

### Title VI 

- Where is the line? UCLA has made no effort to define it

	- What is pervasive? What is severe? Who is tallying the totality of the circumstances so that when the line is crossed, it can be stopped before students are denied equal access to education?

- Chilling of free speech

	- Due to imbalanced discipline and policing

- Denial of benefits---access to education 

	- due to injury, fear and intimidation


### What do the students and faculty actually want 

- To feel safe on campus

- Less militarization of campus

	- "But if any kind of reconciliation is at all possible, the administration must lay a new foundation for the future. In our view, the process has to begin with this first step.

	Apologize."
