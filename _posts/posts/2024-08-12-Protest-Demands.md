Thesis: Correlation with the conflict in Gaza is not necessarily causation. 

""While many of the demands of pro-Palestinian groups may coincide with the ongoing conflict in Gaza, this correlation does not imply that the war directly causes these demands. Instead, the rhetoric among these groups often aligns more closely with the longstanding anti-Israel doctrine promoted by Hamas, suggesting that these demands are rooted in broader ideological beliefs rather than being solely a reaction to the current conflict."

This way, you clearly separate the timing of events from the underlying ideological consistency that might be driving the rhetoric."


- Background and context

			- Establish the position of these organizations 

				- Protected activity

					- Qualification of this speech as abhorrent or not is irrelevant, it is protected 

					- They dispute the statehood of Israel

						- The broader picture shows more than interest in ending the Gaza conflict, or ending "occupation"

						- They use several mechanisms to undermine Israel's legitimacy 

		- Unprotected activity

		- Student grievances 



## Context, history, "Expert" Opinion and Data

- What are the implications of the protest demands?

	- Boycotts 

		- Israeli universities 

		- Nazarian Center

- David Myers early article (from years back)?

	- This goes against the philosophy of free exchange of ideas between universities 




## Reform Doesn't Address Systemic Issues

- The protest demands went far beyond the conflict in Gaza

	- The fact that the [demands weren't met](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-divestment) isn't what's important

		- Why were the demands so far reaching?

		- What does that mean for UCLA moving forward? 

			- The motivations behind these demands will continue to drive organizations like UC Divest, CAC, and SJP

	"Yes, the criteria set forth by PACBI can be seen as broad and potentially vague, which raises concerns about how they are applied. The idea that any Israeli cultural institution could be deemed complicit in "rebranding" or supporting the policies against Palestinians does leave room for wide interpretation. This could indeed result in many, if not all, Israeli cultural institutions being targeted by the boycott, regardless of their specific activities or the views of individuals within those institutions.

The vagueness lies in the interpretation of what constitutes complicity and rebranding. For example, a cultural institution might be involved in activities that are apolitical or even critical of the Israeli government, yet it could still be targeted if it's seen as contributing to Israel's international image. This broad application can be problematic because it doesn't always allow for a nuanced understanding of the diverse roles that cultural institutions play, nor does it differentiate between varying degrees of involvement or complicity.

Critics of the boycott argue that this broad and vague approach could unfairly target institutions and individuals, leading to accusations of discrimination and undermining the principles of academic and cultural freedom. On the other hand, supporters argue that the complexity of the situation requires a broad approach to effectively pressure Israel to change its policies. This tension between the need for a broad strategy and the potential for overreach is at the heart of many debates about the PACBI boycott."

Despite the obvious antisemitism on campus, where are the resolutions in the last few years condemning antisemitism? 

https://www.usac.ucla.edu/documents/resolutions

The Gene Block resolution is missing from the above

Hillel International will not sponsor a University Hillel that supports BDS, or rhetoric that opposes the right for Israel to exist, this is likely why USAC will not interact with them. Which is against their constitution.
