### Constructive notice---is UCLA aware of what's going on?

- How can climate be addressed if there is no oversight? 


### Protests 

- [Off campus protests](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTYyrwrue7/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=63fa4fd5-c1f3-4506-9d75-3cd1c6100342)

	- Assault, intimidation

	- Police did not intervene or told them to leave

- "Green fireworks shoot up in front of Royce Hall as counter-protesters look on. Fireworks were released from outside the encampment toward the inside of it.

### A hostile environment by totality of circumstances 


- Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

		- [Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"

	- Warranted [condemnation by Block and Drake](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) on Nov 10th, although the previous incident was not explicitly condemned. 

		- " At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable."













### Illustrate free speech, treated as protected 

- Extreme political positions

	- Moshiach flag guy 



- May cause tensions to flare, UCLA won't get involved 

	- February rally 

		- Heckling 

	- Sunday before April 30th (Myers article)

### Illustrate free speech, unprotected---treated as a gray area

- When "equal rights give way to free speech"---UCLA permits more extreme cases of discrimination

	- Given the state of campus climate, by totality of circumstances, removal was appropriate 

		- Did not remove it, waited to condemn it 

		- Did not hold anyone accountable (UC Divest)

	- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

		- Made it into social media posts, Op-eds, news articles (which news articles?)

- The April 30th protest was a hotbed for hate speech and discrimination 

	- Instances of discrimination quietly removed

		- Students mentioned they wanted to leave campus due to "clear signs of discrimination" happening 

		- Triangles made it into several articles as the "face of the protest"
	
		- No acknowledgment
