Thesis1: Policy that works requires *balance*. Anti-discrimination education that serves everyone. Policing that targets the actual problems that are occurring using the appropriate amount of resources. Free speech that acknowledges anti-discrimination laws.

Thesis2: Umbrella responses unfairly target certain groups, chill free speech, and leave certain members of the community vulnerable to continual harm.

### Policy 

- [UC policy on student rights](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710537/PACAOS-170)

	- "171.11 To the extent appropriate to the circumstances, to be free from University discipline for actions committed involuntarily or under duress."

	- Is in direct contention with---[UC Board of Regents statement on conduct guidelines issued by UC President Michael V. Drake, M.D.](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-board-regents-statement-conduct-guidelines-issued-uc-president-michael-v-drake-md)

	- "Any member of the university community who is arrested for unlawful behavior or cited for a violation of university policy must go through the applicable review process, such as student code of conduct or employee disciplinary process.

		The Regents further affirmed that amnesty for students, faculty and staff is inconsistent with this guideline."

	- "UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said UCPD will enforce campus policy banning people from setting up tents on campus property but only if and when they can do so “safely and effectively.” “We don’t want a repeat of the conflicts that marred last semester’s events,” Mogulof said. When tents were erected on campus during the Nov. 9 Occupy Cal protest, police officers physically confronted hundreds of protesters, making arrests, taking down the tents and injuring several people. In response to the Albany occupation, the university turned off the water supply that provides irrigation to the land. “This land is"

	- "24 students and community members filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against UC Berkeley administrators and police, alleging excessive force and violations of free speech rights. In 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the police brutality claims, stating that the officers' use of force was minimal and that university officials were not liable."

	- "The settlement should be a wake-up call for other universities and police departments," said Michael Risher, staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. "If the First Amendment means anything, it's that you should be able to demonstrate without being afraid of police violence."

	UCPD with less lethal alternatives to standard-issue firearms, for use in extraordinary public
	circumstances."

### Robinson/Edley report

- Brought up in the 2024 UC toolkit

- Statistics from DB and policy reports on UCLA protests being largely peaceful 

- What's the point of this beautifully thought out policy that administrators signed their commitment to, if when push comes to shove they take the path of least resistance and all of a sudden it's Texas in California. 

- Administrators *need* to back up everything they do with policy. Not "we are heartbroken," again giving 2004 kind of response to events and incidents that can affect hundreds of students. Everything must come from study, data, and training on the subject. Nothing of large magnitude affecting hundreds of students can be dealt with by administrative "parenting" or instinct. 

### Directly relevant UC policies 

- No masking

- No encampments 

- LA Times article on spending 

- What the Regents Chair said about "safety"

- Regents resolution on distancing from polemic messaging (did that get approved?)

- Heavy policing is a UC standard 

	- UC Divest Protest to Regents meeting

		- Many officers present


### UC policy 

- Drake's policing with safety policy

- [Passed measure J2](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/17/uc-regents-votes-to-pass-item-j2-following-months-of-revision-and-deferred-voting)

- [UCSA says that they can add a disclaimer](https://www.instagram.com/p/C90ZaFDSty9/?img_index=1), not sure that is the case

- [SJP take](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-BXNiNiNKt/?hl=en&img_index=1)

### UCLA Policy

- UCLA campus safety report 

- UCLA 4 point plan

	- Myers appointed to address campus climate

- What is the point of any of the above if the university doesn't even enforce its own policy on remedial anti-discrimination training

- The UC non-discrimination policy

	- “Training and Education for the Respondent: • If an individual is found to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct under the policy, the respondent may be required to undergo training as a corrective or remedial measure. • The respondent may also need to participate in periodic refresher classes to reinforce appropriate behavior and compliance with anti-discrimination standards.”

	- By the UC anti-discrimination policy, respondents are subject to anti-discrimination training and education. By failing to hold the discriminating persons accountable, they are effectively denying them access to a Title VI education.

- Discrimination that crosses the line opens the door for teachable moments 

	- Forces students to communicate using legal free speech

	- This will aid in becoming more effective communicators after college

	- It also opens the forum for civil discourse---a more meaningful use of time and resources 

	- Denying them anti-discrimination education means they do not care about these individuals and they do not care about campus climate.

### State policy 

- CA witholding funds

- Laws put in place (Scott Wiener)

	- Is it balanced

	- [SJP take, anti-Muslim education is optional (is it?)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAwUcHky-MM/?hl=en&img_index=3)

### Title VI 

- Where is the line? UCLA has made no effort to define it

	- What is pervasive? What is severe? Who is tallying the totality of the circumstances so that when the line is crossed, it can be stopped before students are denied equal access to education?

- Chilling of free speech

	- Due to imbalanced discipline and policing

- Denial of benefits---access to education 

	- due to injury, fear and intimidation


### Town hall 

- LA Times mentioned a town hall
