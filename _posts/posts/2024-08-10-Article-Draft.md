## Introduction

- Draw a connection between what is happening on the national level and UCLA: the antisemitic activity that occurred in D.C. during Netanyahu visit 
	
	- Graffiti at UCLA

	- Similar symbolism at the UCLA protest 

	- Lavie Levi's statement

		- https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment

- Opening incident: The protest itself---the intention was to bring UCLA to the table but nothing productive came of the week-long encampment, rallies and protests. The only lasting result---serious incidents involving discrimination and violence 

	- Eli Tsives blocked from entering an area of campus (taken on video)

		- He made a point to emphasize "that he pays tuition"

	- Physical barriers were also in place to keep so-called "Zionists" out

		- Masked non-affiliates with weapons attacked the encampment

- Transitional statement

	- There was clear rule breaking on both sides, so why did UCLA allow it to continue for days until things got completely out of hand? 

- Thesis statement: A lack of oversight by UCLA administration has led to problematic incidents involving discrimination and violence

## Background and Context

- UCLA philosophy: 
	
	1. Constitutional freedoms above all else

		- https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media

		- Block's House Opening Remarks

			- https://chancellor.ucla.edu/writings-speeches/opening-remarks-to-u-s-house-committee-on-education-and-the-workforce/ 

	2. Self-governance

		- USAC charges mandatory fees from student tuition in order to run a large portion of undergraduate life

	3. "True Bruin Values."

		- Mary Osako statement

		- https://truebruin.ucla.edu/

	4. "Student safety."

		- https://dailybruin.com/2024/01/29/uclas-open-campus-raises-questions-around-student-safety

- Policy and control: How does UCLA policy support the above? What systems are in place, if any? Where there is a lack of systems, what patterns have emerged? 

	- Policies on student and group misconduct

		- https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/2f52f587-8b22-4633-a4f5-d79ee25cea9b

		- rules 

		- reporting

		- consequences

	- A pattern of using a "weak" tone in condemnation

		- Despite acknowledgement by Jewish groups that antisemitism is happening on campus

			- https://www.jewishla.org/the-jewish-federation-of-greater-los-angeles-launches-campus-impact-network-to-address-antisemitism-on-college-campuses/

			- https://www.jewishfoundationla.org/grant/la-campuses-united-against-antisemitism/

		- Incidents by unknown student perpetrators continue

			- incidents leading up to major protest events 

				- UCLA controls the optics. They take a "nothing is wrong, this stuff is happening out of nowhere" stance. They are treating each incident as a "one-off"

	- Or vague promises of investigations and punishment

		- Policies on non-affiliate misconduct

			- rules 

				- cryptic flyer

				- https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs#:~:text=No%20non%2Daffiliate%20shall%20solicit,profit%20or%20otherwise%2C%20except%20as

			- reporting?

			- consequences?

		- Aggressive incidents between students and offenders

			- incidents leading up to major protest events and UCLA's handling

		- Follow up on pre-protest incidents

			- SJP meeting 

				- what was the reaction by the administration? 

				- what is the current status of the case? 

    - UCLA totally ignores organizational activity, even when it is brought to their attention  

		- Pro-Hamas rhetoric by student organizations (yet action item J1 was drawn up to control professors?)

			- Hamas doctrine

		- USAC abuse of power (how long had this been going on?)

			- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVu1gC2K_oXhMl7-516jBoLsn1q3z9J5OE4HGqRdi_U/edit

		- Calls for Verdugo's impeachment

			- https://www.jewishfoundationla.org/grant/la-campuses-united-against-antisemitism/

	- Inaction has consequences & these issues are connected

		- Toxic campus environment for Jewish students

		- Antisemitic rhetoric by the USAC was causing aggression from non-affiliate members of the greater LA community

			- CAC's public position & activities are being followed by the greater LA community

		- There is a very large pro-Israel, non-affiliate population who regularly visits UCLA to pick fights with students

			- UCLA has not taken proper measures to stop or minimize harassment, intimidation, and aggression from happening

		- There is evidence that violence and aggression from non-affiliates and police misconduct was serving to inflame pro-Palestinian members of the UCLA community

	- Some condemnation by the chancellor, the regents, and one measure to "Control" free speech: Action item J1

	- https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-21/uc-regents-dicuss-tightening-controls-of-opinion-on-campus-websites

		- Background and context to the Regents meeting

			- Reason for meeting

			- What were the protests about

			- What was the police response 

## In-depth Analysis of Protest Handling and Misconduct

- Students reported to the Daily Bruin that symbolism and chants made them uncomfortable

	- Brushed under the rug by cleaning everything up (not before major news outlets snapped several photos) without any condemnation 

	- Chants continued throughout protests

		- Reddit and the other evidence gathered

		- https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNVpURRG/

- Back to students blockading campus and Eli Tsives

	- Lawsuit 

		- explain the basis for exclusion---students must renounce Israel

	- Any manner of exclusion makes the encampments and protests "unlawful" or against code and policy, but the real issue should be revealed

		- It is not an issue of a "Jew Exclusion Zone" it is an issue of forcibly imposing political positions and subjugating students based on Israeli heritage, if in essence they have to renounce the state of Israel for access to campus. Any student that is international or has ancestral ties to Israel must renounce these ties. 

		- If the argument is "Jew Exclusion Zone" it will be immediately debunked and disregarded by the pro-Palestinian and general student population. 

		- Must go with the broadest terms, in order to withstand all anecdotal evidence that might contradict what looked like the true motive. They excluded people, enough said. 

			- https://www.instagram.com/israelismfilm/reel/C6erq2KOYyY/ and Jewish Voices for Peace

- There was next to no guidance on time, place, and manner restrictions and UCLA demonstration policies 

	- Time, place, and manner policies are located here

		- https://sole.ucla.edu/file/4efd2db6-2863-447e-acb3-ca109fa5b33c

	- UCLA seemed deliberately vague (in the name of "freedoms protection?") with respect to appropriate protest conduct

		- This lead to students blockading other students, including Jewish and handicapped students

- The lack of UCLA guidance and unwillingness to engage with the encampment led to the endangerment of UCLA students

    - Flyer released by UCLA and email late in the day 

    - response by UCLA Divest 

    - delayed police response

		- Other videos of violence by masked perps with weapons

- Why were Pro-Israel protesters allowed to protest within the same space as pro-Palestinian protesters, yet restrictions were imposed on "place" during the regents meeting? It is likely because they can't qualify the protest "position," their judgment  remains "content-neutral" consistent with time, place and manner stipulations. They just piled everyone in a "designated" protest area, whereas the Regents meeting was not in one of these areas. Then they should have separated the protesters based on "manner" restrictions, as the manner in which they were protesting was not peaceful from the start. 

	- This led to increasing tension between students and non-affiliates

	- Major players are pointing fingers at each other

		- Video by Karen Bass 

		- Late night tweets and UCLA statements 

		- Block statement immediately afterwards

- Police misconduct immediately following April 30th 

	- CalMatters footage

## Context, history, "Expert" Opinion and Data

- What are the implications of the protest demands?

	- Boycotts 

		- Israeli universities 

		- Nazarian Center

			- the preamble is a basis for this

- David Myers early article (from years back)?

	- This goes against the philosophy of free exchange of ideas between universities 

- David Myers on the antisemitic display

- David Myers on the nights leading up to major protest incident and the major protest incident

## Student and Faculty Opinions

- There is more evidence that "Zionist" was the basis for exclusion from areas of campus

	- The term "Zionist" is extremely divisive 

	- The pro-Palestinian movement is being deliberately vague about its definition, in order to pose its targeting of Israeli statehood as a target on "expansionist colonizers"

		- JVP

		- Hamas doctrine and evidence of anti-Israeli rhetoric 

- Students felt they didn't have an "American viewpoint" when it came to the pro-Palestinian protests
	
	- Without any support or condemnation with respect to organizational rhetoric, a vacuum is created

		- SJP was the "authority" on encampment conduct leading to civil rights infringements of Jewish students

		- Created an extremely polarized protest environment 

			- Created more division between students

			- Created more animosity between students and non-affiliates

			- The general UCLA student body may become indoctrinated by chants, symbolism, and extreme rhetoric 

- Exclusion from areas of campus faced enormous confusion and backlash

	- https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ch82s8/its_affecting_students_now/

	- disabled students

	- students completely confused by exclusion tactics, began using identity to prove or disprove assumed motives

- Student and faculty positions are often identity-driven

- Without positional guidance (UCLA as a voice itself)

	- Campus culture becomes extremely polarized

- UCLA weak follow ups on incidents or no interaction with orgs at all 

	- Student orgs resigned to handle matters themselves

- What involvement they do have, the rhetoric lacked "balance"

	- Polarizes campus culture

- "Reporting" of grievances with administration posted to social media or Daily Bruin without any follow up or acknowledgment 

Bottom line: There is a difference between eliminating voices (which would go against higher learning philosophy and constitutional freedoms), and adding to the conversation, UCLA should understand the difference 

## Attempts at Reform

- Office of Campus Safety

- https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-announces-nationally-recognized-firm-will-review-actions-led-violent-events-ucla

- Chancellor Block's congressional hearing (the story was UCLA was afraid for student safety? Was that how it really played out?)

- Is there any explanation for why protesters were not better regulated based on the time, place and manner restrictions that Block repeated so many times at the hearing? 

- Training and education don't go far enough

	- Existing Title VI education and policy/support infrastructure at UCLA

	- Proposed changes to education and policy/support infrastructure at UCLA

	- Title IX is mandatory

		- Some Title IX should be be grouped in with Title VI

## Reform Doesn't Address Systemic Issues

Thesis: Without addressing the issues underlying these incidents---now systemic problems---their inaction can be defined as "institutional negligence." 

- UCLA wants to address the symptoms---violence/safety/specific incidents of discrimination---but they continue to ignore the deeper issues

	- UCPD Chief was fired

	- Even with the new policing guy in place, police are still mishandling protest situations 

		- https://www.instagram.com/p/C8ELJJRODh7/?hl=en

		- https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/nyregion/how-the-nypd-quietly-shuts-down-discipline-cases-against-officers.html

	- Osako said "not to request law enforcement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community"

		- UCLA needs to define the threshold for "preemptively" in order to know what constitutes an "unsafe environment." Because the moment a non-affiliate shows up on campus with a mask on for example, the environment is now "unsafe."

		- Scuffles, fights and aggressive behavior occurred on several nights leading up to the 30th, the environment from that point forward is then "unsafe"

	- Are UCPD trained in non-affiliate policy? 

		- Why have the non-affiliate policies in place if they are not enforced? 

- The protest demands went far beyond the conflict in Gaza

	- The fact that the [demands weren't met](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-divestment) isn't what's important

		- Why were the demands so far reaching?

		- What does that mean for UCLA moving forward? 

			- The motivations behind these demands will continue to drive organizations like UC Divest, CAC, and SJP

- USAC represents an abuse of power 

	- Some voting data. The Jewish demographic does not represent a large enough voting bloc, theoretically or practically, to change election results. The Israeli students are a subset of both the international and Jewish communities, which means they cannot change USAC voting outcomes. 

		- https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/17/bruins-elect-1st-international-student-as-usac-president-in-2024-elections

		- https://www.jewishfoundationla.org/grant-org/hillel-at-ucla/#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20center%20of,and%20empowers%20110%20student%20leaders

		- https://www.hillel.org/college/university-of-california-los-angeles/

		- https://www.ucla.edu/about/facts-and-figures

- Students post grievances on social media because they are accustomed to being "ignored" and they don't understand the accountability systems

	- There's a conflict of interest in the conduct-report-punishment loop

	- USAC can't be trusted to hold their own accountable

	- The "group" conduct policies could have been a way to hold CAC accountable, why didn't anyone know to use it? 

## Broader Impact and Data

- Comparative Analysis: Comparison with other UC's and their handling of the protests

- State witholding funds until regents come up with a plan

	- https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-15/uc-regents-say-no-to-encampments-and-codes-must-be-enforced#:~:text=%E2%80%9CEncampments%20are%20not%20allowed%2C%E2%80%9D,been%20in%20place%20since%202017.%E2%80%9D

- Will the state efforts at reform go far enough? 

	- They need to look farther than encampments and education

		- The USAC have re-elected Verdugo

			- Recent X posts (Obama follows CAC at UCLA) reveal anti-state of Israel rhetoric

				- https://x.com/culturalaffairs

				- reposts

					- https://x.com/jawn/status/1812257991045111925

					- https://x.com/mxmsworld/status/1816579036560158872

					- https://x.com/itranslate123/status/1292459086257295360

		- The issue is broader than protests and encampments, UCLA itself is a "Jew Exclusion Zone" if the student government is permitted to continue with impunity

			- If the basis for exclusion at the encampments have somehow "bled" into USAC rhetoric, conduct, and policy; if this activity goes deeper than just the encampments themselves, this is the systemic problem 

			- While the issue continues to be conflated

				- https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1efhxn3/ucla_ordered_by_judge_to_craft_plan_in_support_of/

			- It should be made clear what the issue is---there is no "citizenship of UCLA" oath that a student is given when extended an offer to attend the university

- UCUES indicates 

	- 2014 https://sairo.ucla.edu/file/2563a13b-6aff-4e3a-9510-846758f78edc

	- https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Saugher-Nojan-2019-2020-Fellowship-Research-Infographic-1.pdf

	- Student surveys are a weak representation of the student body

		- They are voluntary

- Where the UC's have not seen data improvement, they sought to change the way data was gathered rather than reform the Title VI feedback cycle

	- Important questions have been made optional

	- Prior to being optional UCUES indicates

		- Discrimination issues persist

		- Students don't know how to report

## Conclusion

- Big picture: When Netanyahu went to D.C. the Biden administration failed to condemn the antisemitic behavior. This sets a terrible example for the young citizens of the U.S. 

	- Who is there to set an example? Throw in the argument about higher institutional "hands-off" philosophy and whether it should be so literally applied to undergraduates

		- https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media.

- Call to Action: Highlight the need for stronger independent oversight and policy changes to ensure accountability

	- The OCR office continues to shrink and is little more than a complaint box 

		- House committee hearing 

	- The OCR tolerance thresholds need to be re-examined

		- Dear colleague letters 

	- Open OCR cases against UCLA

		- Several cases have been pending while incidents keep happening

	- Like Title IX, Title VI should be expanded, and mandatory

	- Surveys (Title VI and Title IX) should be separate, and mandatory

		- UCUES is too long and covers too much at once

	- It seems like there should be 

		- Better rules for UCPD and campus security to follow regarding expelling non-affiliates from campus when rules are broken

		- Permanent bans from campus for violent offenders

	- But also, who is holding UCLA accountable for not carrying out perfectly good non-affiliate policies already in place?
