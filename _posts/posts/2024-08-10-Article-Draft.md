## Introduction

- Draw a connection between what is happening on the national level and UCLA: the antisemitic activity that occurred in D.C. during Netanyahu visit 
	
	- Graffiti at UCLA

	- Similar symbolism at the UCLA protest 

	- Lavie Levi's statement

		- https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment

- Opening incident: The protest itself---the intention was to bring UCLA to the table but nothing productive came of the week-long encampment, rallies and protests. The only lasting result---serious incidents involving discrimination and violence 

	- Eli Tsives blocked from entering an area of campus (taken on video)

		- He made a point to emphasize "that he pays tuition"

	- Physical barriers were also in place to keep so-called "Zionists" out

		- Masked non-affiliates with weapons attacked the encampment

- Transitional statement

	- There was clear rule breaking on both sides, so why did UCLA allow it to continue for days until things got completely out of hand? 

- Thesis statement: A lack of oversight by UCLA administration has led to problematic incidents involving discrimination and violence

## Background and Context

- UCLA philosophy: 
	
	1. Constitutional freedoms above all else

		- https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media.

		- Block's House Opening Remarks

			- https://chancellor.ucla.edu/writings-speeches/opening-remarks-to-u-s-house-committee-on-education-and-the-workforce/ 

	2. Self-governance

		- USAC charges mandatory fees from student tuition in order to run a large portion of undergraduate life.

			- https://www.usac.ucla.edu/funding/student-fee

			- https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/667dcc22954cc96fa7f548fc/1719520293370/06.27.24+Week+Ending+-+USA+YTD+Budget+Report+-+Run+on+06.27.24.pdf

	3. "True Bruin Values."

		- https://www.ucla.edu/about/mission-and-values

		- https://truebruin.ucla.edu/

	4. "Student safety."

		- https://dailybruin.com/2024/01/29/uclas-open-campus-raises-questions-around-student-safety

- Policy and control: How does UCLA policy support the above? What systems are in place, if any? Where there is a lack of systems, what patterns have emerged? 

	- A pattern of completely ignoring or brushing incidents under the rug without proper condemnation or vague promises of investigations and punishment

		- UCLA controls the optics. They take a "nothing is wrong, this stuff is happening out of nowhere" stance. They are treating each incident as a "one-off"

			- When offenders are UCLA students, this has led to a toxic campus environment for Jewish students

				- https://www.jewishfoundationla.org/grant/la-campuses-united-against-antisemitism/

				- incidents leading up to major protest events and UCLA's handling

			- When offenders are non-affiliates, this has led to aggressive incidents between students and offenders

				- incidents leading up to major protest events and UCLA's handling

	- These issues are connected 

		- There is evidence that antisemitic rhetoric by the USAC was causing aggression from non-affiliate members of the greater LA community

			- The incident is evidence that CAC's public position & activities are being followed by the greater LA community

		- There is evidence that violence and aggression from non-affiliates and police misconduct was serving to inflame pro-Palestinian members of the UCLA community

	- "Control" of free speech: Action item J1

		- Background and context to the Regents meeting

			- Reason for meeting

			- What were the protests about

			- What was the police response 

    - Without addressing the broader issues underlying these incidents---now systemic problems---their inaction can now be defined as "institutional negligence."  

		- Pro-Hamas rhetoric by student organizations (yet action item J1 was drawn up to control professors?)

			- Hamas doctrine

		- USAC abuse of power (how long had this been going on?)

		- The very large pro-Israel, non-affiliate population who regularly visit UCLA to pick fights with students

## In-depth Analysis of Protest Handling and Misconduct

- Students reported to the Daily Bruin that symbolism and chants made them uncomfortable

	- The school cleaned everything up (not before major news outlets snapped several photos) without any condemnation 

	- Chants continued throughout protests

		- Reddit and the other evidence gathered

- There was next to no guidance on time, place, and manner restrictions and UCLA demonstration policies 

	- UCLA seemed deliberately vague (in the name of "freedoms protection?") with respect to appropriate protest conduct

		- This lead to students blockading other students, including Jewish and handicapped students

- The lack of UCLA guidance and unwillingness to engage with the encampment led to the endangerment of UCLA students

    - Flyer released by UCLA and email late in the day 

    - response by UCLA Divest 

	- Videos of violence by masked perps with weapons

	- CalMatters footage

- Why were Pro-Israel protesters allowed to protest within the same space as pro-Palestinian protesters, yet restrictions were imposed on "place" during the regents meeting? It is likely because they can't qualify the protest "position," their judgment  remains "content-neutral" consistent with time, place and manner stipulations. They just piled everyone in a "designated" protest area, whereas the Regents meeting was not in one of these areas. Then they should have separated the protesters based on "manner" restrictions, as the manner in which they were protesting was not peaceful from the start. 

	- This led to increasing tension between students and non-affiliates

	- Major players are pointing fingers at each other

		- Video by Karen Bass 

		- Late night tweets and UCLA statements 

		- Block statement immediately afterwards

## Context, history, "Expert" Opinion and Data

- https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/07/legal-scholars-host-panel-discussing-freedom-of-speech-since-oct-7

- https://www.thefire.org/news/ucla-lacks-intellectual-tolerance-these-alumni-are-banding-together-fix-it

- David Myers early article (from years back)?

	- This goes against the philosophy of free exchange of ideas between universities 

- David Myers on the antisemitic display

- David Myers on the nights leading up to major protest incident and the major protest incident

## Student and Faculty Opinions

- Students felt they didn't have an "American viewpoint" when it came to the pro-Palestinian protests
	
	- Without any support or condemnation with respect to organizational rhetoric, a vacuum is created

		- SJP was the "authority" on encampment conduct leading to civil rights infringements of Jewish students

		- Created an extremely polarized protest environment 

			- Created more division between students

			- Created more animosity between students and non-affiliates

			- The general UCLA student body may become indoctrinated by chants, symbolism, and extreme rhetoric 

- Student and faculty positions are often identity-driven

- Administrative rhetoric lacked "balance"

## Attempts at Reform

- Office of Campus Safety

- Chancellor Block's congressional hearing (the story was UCLA was afraid for student safety? Was that how it really played out?)

- Existing Title VI education and policy/support infrastructure at UCLA

- Proposed changes to education and policy/support infrastructure at UCLA

## Reform Doesn't Address Systemic Issues

- UCLA wants to address the symptoms---violence and safety---but they continue to ignore the deeper issues

	- Training and education don't go far enough

		- Title IX is mandatory

	- USAC represents an abuse of power 

		- Some voting data. The Jewish demographic does not represent a large enough voting bloc, theoretically or practically, to change election results. The Israeli students are a subset of both the international and Jewish communities, which means they cannot change USAC voting outcomes.

			- https://www.hillel.org/college/university-of-california-los-angeles/

			- https://www.ucla.edu/about/facts-and-figures

		- The lawsuit against the regents spoke of taking an oath of allegiance against Israel 

## Broader Impact and Data

- Comparative Analysis: Comparison with other UC's and their handling of the protests

- State witholding funds until regents come up with a plan

	- https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-15/uc-regents-say-no-to-encampments-and-codes-must-be-enforced#:~:text=%E2%80%9CEncampments%20are%20not%20allowed%2C%E2%80%9D,been%20in%20place%20since%202017.%E2%80%9D

- UCUES indicates 

	- 2014 https://sairo.ucla.edu/file/2563a13b-6aff-4e3a-9510-846758f78edc

	- https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Saugher-Nojan-2019-2020-Fellowship-Research-Infographic-1.pdf

	- Student surveys are a weak representation of the student body

	- Discrimination issues persist

	- Students don't know how to report

- Where the UC's have not seen data improvement, they sought to change the way data was gathered rather than reform the Title VI feedback cycle

## Conclusion

- Big picture: When Netanyahu went to D.C. the Biden administration failed to condemn the antisemitic behavior. This sets a terrible example for the young citizens of the U.S. 

	- Who is there to set an example? Throw in the argument about higher institutional "hands-off" philosophy and whether it should be so literally applied to undergraduates

		- https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media.

- Ongoing Issues: Reiterate the systemic failures and ongoing challenges

	- Even with the new policing guy in place, police are still mishandling protest situations (the SJP woman with the loudspeaker)

		- https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/nyregion/how-the-nypd-quietly-shuts-down-discipline-cases-against-officers.html

	- It is not an issue of a "Jew Exclusion Zone" it is an issue of forcibly imposing political positions and subjugating students based on Israeli heritage, if in essence they have to renounce the state of Israel for access to campus. Any student that is international or has ancestral ties to Israel must renounce these ties. If the argument is "Jew Exclusion Zone" it will be immediately debunked and disregarded by the pro-Palestinian and general student population.

- Call to Action: Highlight the need for stronger independent oversight and policy changes to ensure accountability

	- The OCR office continues to shrink and is little more than a complaint box 

		- House committee hearing 

	- The OCR tolerance thresholds need to be re-examined

		- Dear colleague letters 

	- Title VI should be expanded, and mandatory

	- Better rules for UCPD and campus security to follow regarding expelling non-affiliates from campus when rules are broken

	- Permanent bans from campus for violent offenders
