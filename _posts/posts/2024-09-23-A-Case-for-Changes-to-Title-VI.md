Incorporate OCR Policy and Guidance section from "Title VI Notes" and other relevant posts (campus SaVE and relevant OCR Dear Colleague Letters), "Try to get this right..."

- Living in a digital age encourages discrimination-related harassment and bullying (what is the Title IX jurisdiction there, believe it is covered)

- Michigan resolution agreement

	- The system has been flooded with reports and chaos ensued

	- Might be a good place to bring up confusing reporting mechanisms (SCU)



- As indicated by the above, Title IX goes farther than Title VI, it has made incredible progress

	- Student safety was the main driver of progress 

	- Student safety is now a major concern with respect to Title VI



- No school has made an effort to identify or willingly admit there are systemic issues 

	- The UC's continue to create offices and blame students 

		- No masking rules 

		- No encampment rules

		- Office of Campus Safety

	- No effort has been made as a matter of safety or accountability to help the students directly 


- To prove a point 

	- History of incidents not being resolved in a timely manner

	- Many incidents occurring now

	- The law is vague, not properly defined for the educational setting

	- Largely left up to the recipient, who have proven ill-equipped 

	- Based on a broken system it is unknown what other issues are arising 

	- Longevity: these issues will persist indefinitely---due to geopolitical conflict, the vitriolic political climate, foreign students, unfettered access to bias and discriminatory views via social media, and bullying and harassment via social media---and will serve to fill the void in the absence of administrative guidance and Title VI education and enforcement
