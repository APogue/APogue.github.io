Incorporate OCR Policy and Guidance section from "Title VI Notes" and other relevant posts (campus SaVE and relevant OCR Dear Colleague Letters), "Try to get this right..."



- Michigan resolution agreement

	- The system has been flooded with reports and chaos ensued

	- Might be a good place to bring up confusing reporting mechanisms (SCU)



- As indicated by the above, Title IX goes farther than Title VI, it has made incredible progress

	- Student safety was the main driver of progress 

	- Student safety is now a major concern with respect to Title VI



- No school has made an effort to identify or willingly admit there are systemic issues 

	- The UC's continue to create offices and blame students 

		- No masking rules 

		- No encampment rules

		- Office of Campus Safety

	- No effort has been made as a matter of safety or accountability to help the students directly
