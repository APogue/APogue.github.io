### Title IX Coverage


#### Definition 


#### History 


#### Campus SaVE


#### Final Rule 

- mention the updates

### Title VI Coverage


#### Definition 


#### History 


#### Code of Federal Regulations 

- mention the updates 

### Title VI doesn't go far enough, why? 

- Acting as a reactionary agency will not suffice

	- There are enough ongoing investigations to prove that the system should shift from "reactionary" case law and agency guidance to "proactive" direct amendments and regulatory updates

	- Backlog of investigations etc

- The system has been flooded with reports and chaos ensued


### Title IX Isn't Perfect

- Go into the core areas of Title IX that should be the backbone of Title VI 

	- The loop 

		1. Publication of notification 

		2. Literacy wrt rights means two things. They need to be able to recognize when situations arise--- 1. for prevention measures or 2. for reporting purposes

		3. Know who to report to 

		4. Trust the reporting system

- But there are ongoing issues wrt Title IX, describe them here

	- Assault continues to be pervasive

		- 21 school survey

	- No one is reporting
	
		- Incident statistics vs reporting statistics 

		- What are the barriers

		- No one knows the Title IX Coordinator exists or what their actual role is

			- UCUES, 21 school survey, SCU 

			- Knowing reflexively about the Title IX coordinator can help reduce other barriers

			- GW has an outstanding [Title IX website](https://titleix.gwu.edu/), it makes the UC website look really bad

		- There's anxiety about possible outcomes 

			- The goal should be to encourage people, if nothing else, to just submit a report 

				- It should be clear to students first and foremost that an arrest does not have to be made and a Title IX investigation does not need to be initiated

					- Beyond this step, they should trust that the grievance process is discrete and fair 

- Annual Title IX report vs the Clery Report

	- [GW annual report](https://titleix.gwu.edu/title-ix-office-annual-reports) vs. [GW Clery Report](https://police.gwu.edu/annual-security-fire-safety-report)

	- [UCLA annual report](https://ucla.app.box.com/s/eyri3lej5htfl7uwkv7huhp9o8y3revo) vs. [UCLA Clery Report](https://www.ucpd.ucla.edu/reports-statistics/jeanne-clery-act)

		- Clery jurisdiction off-campus only includes campus-affiliated properties. In UCLA's case, this includes the fraternities and sororities. [site](https://www.ucpd.ucla.edu/reports-statistics/jeanne-clery-act/campus-security-authorities-csa)

	- [SCU no annual report](https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/about/documents/) yet they have [problems](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/multiple-alleged-sexual-assaults-reported-at-santa-clara-university/) that are not accounted for in the [SCU Clery Report](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/university-operations/campus-safety/campus-safety/annual-clery-pdfs/2023-Main-Campus-ASR-Final.pdf)

		- SCU dissociated all fraternities and sororities years ago. They *do not fall* under Clery jurisdiction 

- For *both* Title IX and Title VI, *in the training*, they need to be *promoting a culture of reporting and safety*

	- Undue burden wrt Coordinator buried in legal material 

	- Current training is focused on social situations

		- SaVE website---"Most higher education institutions—including community colleges and vocational schools—must educate students, faculty, and staff on the prevention of rape, acquaintance rape, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking."

		- Reference the SaVE document training list

		- According to the [AAU survey](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Key-Issues/Campus-Safety/Revised%20Aggregate%20report%20%20and%20appendices%201-7_(01-16-2020_FINAL).pdf), between 2015 and 2019 students had a better understanding of "the definition of sexual assault and other sexual misconduct, where there were increases
		of 11.5 percentage points for undergraduate women and 12.4 percentage points for
		undergraduate men."

		- Add a Title IX Module

			- Who do you report to? Either Title IX Coordinator, Campus PD, or Title IX officials can assist in filing a report with campus PD

			- Do you have to pursue a Title IX or criminal investigation if you submit a report? No, you can file a report without a Title IX or criminal investigation 

			- What circumstances will lead to an investigation regardless of the complainant's wishes? Situations involving A. A weapon B. A minor C. Multiple respondents, D. A high degree of violence or E. Any of the above? E

			- Should you pursue a Title IX investigation, you have the right to an investigation that is A. Prompt B. *Discrete* C. Equitable or D. All of the above. D

	- Title IX codified sexual harassment in 2020

		- 21 school statistics
	
	- But it does not *proactively address* sexual harassment & sexual harassment is one among several protections afforded by Title IX that are not covered by Campus SaVE (it did address quid pro quo harassment).

		- "Sexual harassment refers to behaviors with sexual connotations that interfered with an individual’s
	academic or professional performance, limited the individual’s ability to participate in an academic
	program, or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive social, academic, or work environment." (AAU Climate Survey)
	
		- Gender discrimination 
	
	- Similar issues of program exclusion may fall under Title VI

		- The POC student on Reddit

	- There are two circumstances under which we can define a problem as "pervasive," 

		1. there are a lot of reports (as in antisemitism and anti-muslim discrimination)

		2. students are surveyed (as in SVSH)

	- If in the above, we have not surveyed the students, there is no way to know whether a low number of reports are due to a low number of incidents or a broken reporting loop. 

	- With reference to all of the above, under the present conditions neither Title VI or Title IX are likely to make a statistical difference without literacy---students need to know their rights. 

		1. Students are unable to recognize problematic scenarios when they arise

		2. Students are not trained in preventative measures

		3. Students do not know the Title Coordinators exist or what their roles are 


	- A separate training (series of) module(s)

		- Training focused on *academic* and *on-campus* scenarios 

		- Title VI

			- Safety on campus

			- De-escalation tactics

			- Behavior contributing to a hostile environment, ie discrimination, etc. 

				- Discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, shared ancestry

			- Reporting

		- Title IX

			- Sexual Harassment (move the quid pro quo here)

			- Gender and gender identity discrimination

			- Reporting

- Why is there a stigma in talking about SVSH? Why don't we know how pervasive SVSH is? Why aren't students surveyed? 

	- How can anyone have any idea if the number of reports coming in reflects a working loop without surveying the students? Is this not a concern for the well-being of the students? 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


###  Title IX is a working model for Title VI 

- We have all felt protected by Title IX

	- The entire UCLA community receives Title IX education annually 

		- [Training required annually](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/education-training/undergraduate-students), failure to complete training results in registration hold on account 

- Who do we have to thank for this? 

	- [Training requirements](https://equity.ucla.edu/education/mandatory-trainings/t9-sexual-violence-sexual-harassment-training/#student) and relevant policies 

### Title IX and Title VI definitions (chronological)

- This is the definition of Title VI

- This is the definition of Title IX

### Administrative Enforcement of Title IX and Title VI

- There is a discrepancy with respect to how they're enforced

- They key to Title IX is

	- Notification of rights

	- Competency with respect to these rights 

	- Having knowledge of who to report to 

	- A Title IX Coordinator to ensure compliance 

		- Why are they important? 

	- Campus SaVE Act goes farther, requiring periodic reporting

- Title VI designed by the "recipient" 

	- Notification of rights do not go as far

	- Optional training (freshman orientation)

	- Confusing reporting mechanism

	- No legal obligation to respond to reports 


### The Civil Rights Protection Mechanism 

- As indicated by the above, Title IX goes farther than Title VI, it has made incredible progress

	- Student safety was the main driver of progress 

	- Student safety is now a major concern with respect to Title VI

		- Training is a large part of that progress

		- Why Title IX training (theoretically) works 

			- Competency with respect to rights

			- The training ranges from social awareness and de-escalation to behavioral aid in a potentially unsafe situation 

				- "shelly is struggling in school, you talk to her and it seems shes upset about..."

### There is still a need for progress 

- The original purpose for Title IX went beyond student safety

- History of Title IX 

- Proves that in essence, these are similar civil rights protections to Title VI

- Given these acts were created to broaden access to education, there needs to be progress here as well	

#### The case for education 

- Inadequate Title IX and Title VI protections require attention 

	- Based on the last year, it is impossible to say that the current standard for Title VI is working, we know that with respect to antisemitic and anti-Muslim activity

	- Based on these issues why would we assume it is working at all? 

	- The "protection mechanism"

		- Is the law vague with respect to what constitutes "protection of rights?"

		- Discrepancies in notification 

			- Title IX rights are made available to every student, by law

			- Title VI is there a legal obligation to make rights available to every student? 

		- If part of the protection mechanism relies on the student then they must be literate with respect to these rights

			- Relevant areas of Title IX beyond SVSH should be covered

			- All or relevant areas of Title VI should be covered

				- UCUES group participation portion as evidence

### Given these shortcomings, can we say civil rights protections are working? Can we say with confidence they are doing what was intended? 

#### The case for a coordinator

- If the law is vague, and its left up to the recipient---who may themselves be the subject of reports---to define "access to education" then that access will inevitably be vulnerable

	- Based on Michigan the schools themselves don't know Title VI 

		- Decentralized reporting with little to no accountability

		- Difficulty deciphering between creation of a hostile environment and protected speech

	- No school has made an effort to identify or willingly admit there are systemic issues 

		- The UC's continue to create offices and blame students 

			- No masking rules 

			- No encampment rules

			- Office of Campus Safety

		- No effort has been made as a matter of safety or accountability to help the students directly 

- UCLA annual data report has inexplicable discrepancies 

	- Civil rights reporting is low compared to Title IX 

- If the number of reports is low, there is no way to determine whether this is due to a functioning system and recipient compliance, or whether this is because the student portion of the feedback cycle is broken 

### UCUES indicates 

- To have a clearer picture on the above...

	- Survey the students, do they know who to report to?

	- Even if the students know who to report to, do they know when to report if they don't properly understand their rights? 

- The UCUES survey indicates

	- Students do not know who to report to

- Problems with UCUES

	- UCUES is optional 

	- UCUES is massive 

	- UCUES made certain civil rights questions optional, in an optional survey 

### What the students need 

- Campus SaVE took a Dear Colleague letter and made it into law

- The number of cases pending and the time it takes to conduct investigations across post-secondary institutions is a problem

- How much damage has to be done by forcing OCR to continue functioning as a reaction mechanism? 

- Take the Dear Colleague Letters, take the Resolution Letters and Agreements and turn them into law

- Beyond this

	- Model Title VI like Title IX

		- Title VI coordinator

	- Survey the students, separate it from UCUES, and make it mandatory 

		- Do parents want to know that only 75% of their kids know who to report SVSH to? Clearly the answer is no, which is why UCUES made it optional 

- It would also be nice 

	- Accountability reporting

		- Campus climate is a problem in some areas

		- What are the diversity enrollments in STEM?

			- If we don't know, how can we say there's no correlation between minority enrollment and STEM "climate?"

	- More money for DOE and OCR
