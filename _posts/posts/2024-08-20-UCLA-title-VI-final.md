## UCLA discrimination infrastructure

Gene Block promised changes but none has been implemented

EDI runs Title IX office and OCR (DPO is not online, operative word, "prevention")

EDI outlines the conduct chart, that relies on administrative holds to function

All OCR relies heavily on complaint filing with no real education infrastructure

Title IX is different because it is mandatory 

Data and reporting, is it more complete wrt Title IX?

The office uses a misnomer to link to "civil rights training" or something, it is Title IX training

Orientation still has the Title VI and "anti-discrimination" training, and freshman orientation is optional 

The SAIROS social media study is dated


## DOE discrimination infrastructure

Pending cases date back to 2014

There should be more transparency at least with respect to progress

Largely functions as a complaint box wrt Title VI 

What kind of funding are they getting?

Thresholds need to be reevaluated 

Dear colleague letters are mere suggestions 


## The accountability feedback loop 

Survey the students

Educate the students 

Monitor complaints 

Report survey feedback and ongoing changes to address issues 


## The greater discrimination problem

History wrt Title IX 

Efforts to address discrimination across the board would help campus culture 


## The future of civil rights accountability 

Who is looking to effectively defund them? 

The need-based issues should be funded first
