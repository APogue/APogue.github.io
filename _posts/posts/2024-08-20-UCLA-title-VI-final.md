### U Mich resolution agreement 

- [Link to resolution agreement](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/15242066-a.pdf)

- Written by Brian Gnandt, Regional Program Manager

	- "This letter is not a formal statement of OCR policy and should not be relied upon, cited, or construed as such."
 
- "Before OCR completed its investigation, the University expressed an interest in
	resolving the complaints pursuant to Section 302 of OCR’s Case Processing Manual."

- "The regulation implementing Title VI, at 34 C.F.R. § 100.3, provides that no person shall, on the
	basis of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits
	of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program to which Title VI applies."

- "To establish a violation of Title VI under the hostile environment theory, OCR must find that: (1)
a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin existed; (2) the recipient had actual
or constructive notice of the hostile environment; and (3) the recipient failed to take prompt and
effective action to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and
prevent the harassment from recurring."

- Actual v. constructive notice

	- "A recipient is charged with constructive notice of a
hostile environment if, upon reasonably diligent inquiry in the exercise of reasonable care, it
should have known of the discrimination."

	- "In other words, if the recipient could have found out
about the harassment had it made a proper inquiry, and if the recipient should have made such an
inquiry, knowledge of the harassment will be imputed to the recipient."

- Response

	- "Once a recipient has actual or constructive notice of a hostile environment, the recipient has a
legal duty to take reasonable steps to eliminate it. OCR evaluates the appropriateness of the
responsive action by assessing whether it was reasonable, timely, and effective."



### A Hostile Environment 

- "The existence of a hostile environment based on national origin that is created, encouraged, accepted, tolerated, or left
	uncorrected by a recipient constitutes discrimination on the basis of national origin in violation
	of Title VI."

	- Two scenarios 

		- One where you have what looks like protected speech, that is pervasive and made "in bad faith," yet is written off by the administration as protected

		- Another where you have clear incidents of Title VI violations (that may or may not be addressed through legal or policy channels) that are not addressed with respect to campus climate

- "OCR interprets Title VI to mean that the following type of harassment creates a hostile
environment: unwelcome conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively
and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to
participate in or benefit from a recipient’s education program or activity."

	- Key words: *"based on the totality of the circumstances"*

		- "OCR will examine the context, nature, scope, frequency, duration, and location of the harassment, as well as the
	identity, number, and relationships of the persons involved. If OCR determines that the
	harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive that it would have limited the ability of a
	reasonable person, of the same age and national origin as the victim, under the same
	circumstances, from participating in or benefiting from some aspect of the recipient’s education
	program or activity, OCR will find that a hostile environment existed."

		- Case 1: *Israel should not exist* because it rightfully belongs to the indigenous of historic Palestine, protected

		- Case 2: *Israel should not exist* because Jews don't deserve a home, unprotected

- "University's Reporting Process and Policies"

	- "The Student Policies and Procedures define harassment as “harassing or bullying another
person—physically, verbally, or through other means,” and “physically harming and/or directly
threatening harm of any other person or group in a manner which would cause a reasonable
person to fear for physical safety.” The Student Policy further states that where bias or prejudice
motivate the underlying misconduct, there is a separate conduct violation. This includes
behavior motivated by any identity protected by the University’s Nondiscrimination Policy. It
states that sanctions may be enhanced when it is determined that actions were motived by bias,
and that such violation “will be evaluated under current legal standards.”"
