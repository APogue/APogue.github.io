## Background and context

- Block has a contentious history with SJP

	- [Op-ed by Gene Block](https://dailybruin.com/2018/11/18/national-students-for-justice-in-palestine-conference-goes-on-despite-on-campus-protest) argues that pro-Israel delegates should be allowed to participate 

		- As a non-USAC affiliated student org they have no obligation to do this (conflating protected and unprotected activity)

- The Jewish community has a history of actively engaging with the university 

	- [Jewish community](https://scholarworks.brandeis.edu/esploro/outputs/report/9924131723201921#file-2) is the 2nd largest in the United States 

	- They have broad access to campus, policy is strict but not enforced (bring this up when evidence is presented)

		- [Regents of UC](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs#:~:text=CURFEW.,the%20campus%20or%20University%20location.) conduct policy for non-affiliates 

			- 100001.B. ""University Property" means *buildings* and grounds that are operated by, or under the control of, the Regents of the University of California

				- Weapons definition should be expanded, What about bear spray? Fireworks?

	- They organize their own protests on campus and they attend protests they oppose

		- They are aware of what's going on somehow

		- [Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/65093f0232032a4edc39b4f9/1695104770978/A+Resolution+In+Favor+of+Equalized+Access+to+UCLA+for+Non-Commerical+Speech+Events%3B+Specifically+in+Regards+to+SJP.pdf) in response states "Muslim women were verbally harassed and physically assaulted on November 6th by individuals protesting the NJSP conference"

## March Regents meeting 

- [Regents meeting](https://dailybruin.com/2024/03/20/protesters-sit-in-at-luskin-conference-center-ahead-of-uc-regents-vote-on-item-j1) met with protests and police response 

	- "UCPD requested backup from LAPD at around 8:40 p.m."

	- "At least 40 police officers from multiple departments, including UCPD, LAPD and Beverly Hills Police Department, arrived at the hotel and conference center shortly after"

- UC Divest "shut it down" (police footage) [IG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C51p_t2SMCH/?hl=en)

	- UC Divest in the above claims that UCPD, LAPD, Culver City PD, and Santa Monica PD were all on the scene

	- 100 plus cops were there

## Protest

- Vague UCLA position for safety assessment from the start

	- Mary Osako [statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-about-encampment-on-campus-april-26) is vague with regard to what constitutes the threshold for an unsafe environment on campus

- Lack of preparedness: aggression happening days before April 30th

	- David Myers present at protest during escalating tension on the *Sunday before* Tuesday, April 30th [article](https://forward.com/opinion/608479/ucla-violence-campus-protests/)

	- [Protest timeline](https://alexiepogue.com/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/)

		- Skirmishes and violent incidents happening days before April 30th

		- Large counter-protester groups congregated

	- Incident that likely was the catalyst for the encampment shutdown the next day [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/ucpd-responds-to-counter-protesters-midnight-attempt-to-breach-encampment)

		- This Rick Braziel [statement](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/24/ucla-spends-millions-on-pro-palestine-protests-considers-attendants-to-fund-costs) makes no sense, they couldn't get a police response together in 24 hrs?

	- Everyone was breaking rules wrt permits, masking, and loitering/encampments

		- Example: the university allowed a disruptive screen to be present on campus for days after its permit expired

		- The university is *not obligated* to treat non-affiliates and students with equal "fairness" wrt timeliness of accountability measures and conduct enforcement

			- "Non-Affiliates: The time, place, manner [document](https://sole.ucla.edu/file/4efd2db6-2863-447e-acb3-ca109fa5b33c) specifies that non-affiliates may be asked to leave campus or face other immediate actions if they violate campus regulations, particularly when they are seen as a disruption (e.g., Section II under "Grounds Open to the Public" and Section IV.A.5). This suggests that non-affiliates can be dealt with swiftly and directly by University officials."

				- This should be official policy---given the same misconduct, non-affiliates are subject to timely disciplinary action that may or may not be consistent with actions taken to hold students accountable

- April 30th UCLA response 

	- No guidance

		- "The univerisity has not previously called the encampment unlawful or unauthorized" [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/block-indicates-potential-consequences-for-protesters-condemns-campus-aggression)

	- No supervision 

		- "We will not leave" statement by UC Divest in [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/block-indicates-potential-consequences-for-protesters-condemns-campus-aggression)

			- IG [statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6aTBAhLoOl/?hl=en&img_index=1)

	- Weak response, too little too late

		- Block sent an email at 5:04 p.m. on April 30th [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/block-indicates-potential-consequences-for-protesters-condemns-campus-aggression)


	- Vague policy measures instead of proper crowd control 

		- Newsroom [statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-30) on the morning of April 30th

		- Totally cryptic [flyer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dmqAjbGiet8_PGS5cG632mjvPVt3geq5/view) largely directed at non-affiliates

			- Without explanation to what they meant by "unlawful" it sounds like they were conjuring "legalese" to get rid of protesters

		- Blocks [email](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/affirming-our-values-in-a-challenging-time) essentially took a policy stance rather than laying out authoritative directives and reasoning behind it

			- Opened the door for "interpretation" of the email as a university position---ie the university's opinion, this was totally confusing

				- This pits the university "against" the protesters, it will cause defiance, rebellion

					- Content-neutral identification of "time, place, and manner" misconduct would be less likely to flare tensions 

				- The administration did not understand or convey the urgency of the matter---this is the main point, the safety issue is why the encampment needed to be cleared right away

- Violence occurred the evening of April 30th 

	- Delayed police response

		- CSC and UCPD present on the scene did little to quell violence [article](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/01/pro-israel-counter-protesters-attempt-to-storm-encampment-sparking-violence)

			- CSC called LAPD sometime before 10:55 p.m. "when the first firework was released"

			- CSC Security: Hired by UCLA, retreated into Kaplan Hall and did not engage with the protesters or counter-protesters

			- Two UCPD cars and one UCLA EMT arrived at 11:13 p.m. but left by 11:21 p.m.

			- UCPD Chief John Thomas mentioned only five to six officers on duty and that officers retreated after coming under attack

			- Around 70 police officers were on the scene by 3 a.m.

		- [Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/14/how-law-enforcement-mishandled-encampment-sweep-at-ucla-according-to-experts) “The attack began around 10:50 p.m., when counter-protesters started throwing fireworks and tear gas into the encampment. Vice Chancellor for Strategic Communications Mary Osako said at 12:12 a.m. in a statement that law enforcement had been called for immediate support. However, police did not intervene until more than two hours later.”

		- Newsroom [statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-disturbances-at-encampment) 12:12 am they called backup 

		- [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNs1PfNg/) talks about delayed police response, states specific times. He got there at 12:20 am, they arrived at 1:45 am, and stood watching for about an hour. Brawling went on for two hours without police intervention.

- UCLA looks at how to "fund" [protest](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/24/ucla-spends-millions-on-pro-palestine-protests-considers-attendants-to-fund-costs)

- 200 plus arrests

- Tracking down perpetrators 

	- Guardian says far-right groups joined the attack [article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/10/college-campus-protests-far-right). Irrelevant? 

	- One individual arrested [article](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/ucla-police-makes-first-arrest-in-connection-with-april-30-attack-on-encampment/)

- Finger pointing 

	- Newsom [statement](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1785726609947046387)

		- Refers to [Mutual Aid Agreements](https://www.caloes.ca.gov/office-of-the-director/operations/response-operations/law-enforcement/mutual-aid-system/)

		- Agreements in effect since 2022 [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/15/documents-reveal-how-ucpd-coordinated-protest-responses-with-other-departments)

	- Karen Bass "shocked and horrified" [statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn9hZ9vbmtI&ab_channel=FOX11LosAngeles)

		- Questions to be answered:

			- Not considered "LAPD" territory---UCPD and CHP respond to calls on UC campuses 

			- Notify law enforcement in advance, can't call backup while events unfolding, when was *mutual aid* called for? 

			- The appropriate "decision makers, where were they?"

			- "Why frankly was the counter-protest happening right next door to the encampment?"

				- Groups can be separated based on content-neutral concerns such as safety and security

			- People need to be held accountable, this might mean someone gets fired, or improvements and recommendations 

- DB points to police mishandling [article](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/14/how-law-enforcement-mishandled-encampment-sweep-at-ucla-according-to-experts)

- Gene Block reflects on the evening before [statement](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/condemning-violence-in-our-community/)

	- States measures to be taken to hold people accountable

		- Follow up? No news wrt holding non-affiliates accountable?

	- Condemns the violence---"However one feels about the encampment, this attack on our students, faculty and community members was utterly unacceptable."

		- Asserts an "opinion" but still an unusual condemnation of non-affiliate activity

- Gene Block testimony [UCLA Policy---Should](https://alexiepogue.com/2024/05/30/In-the-Aftermath-of-the-Protest-Events-People-Should-be-Talking-and-UCLA-Needs-to-Come-to-the-Table/)

	- It was never stated that the encampment posed a safety risk to students, although Block cited safety concerns as the reason for removal at the Committee hearing (Figure 56 @ 44:14). 

		- If Block *was aware of the security risks*, and there was no indication students would leave, why weren’t police reinforcements on standby to head off the mounting tension? 

		- He clearly *was not aware of the security risks*, as evidenced by the statement "law enforcement is on hand to protect and keep safe [students and demonstrators as you vacate]”"

			- From the above we know that the protest was severely understaffed from a safety and security standpoint

- Office of Campus Safety (this might belong in another section)

    - manage UCPD

    - manage Office of Emergency Management 

    - inagural Associate Vice Chancellor Rick Braziel will lead the office


- [UC wide ban on masking, encampment conduct](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/university-of-california-bans-protest-encampments-and-masks-at-all-campuses/ar-AA1p5NYJ?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=U531&cvid=0d398d468d4d433d87e572329e0c74e6&ei=11)

- One would think, what happened was enough to say UCLA is prepared for future incidents, but Columbia's measures indicate they believe closing campus is the safest way forward
