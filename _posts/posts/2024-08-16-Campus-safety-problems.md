## Background and context

- Block has a contentious history with SJP

	- [Op-ed by Gene Block](https://dailybruin.com/2018/11/18/national-students-for-justice-in-palestine-conference-goes-on-despite-on-campus-protest) argues that pro-Israel delegates should be allowed to participate 

		- As a non-USAC affiliated student org they have no obligation to do this

- The Jewish community has a history of actively engaging with the university 

	- [Jewish community](https://scholarworks.brandeis.edu/esploro/outputs/report/9924131723201921#file-2) is the 2nd largest in the united states 

	- They have broad access to campus, policy is strict but not enforced (bring this up when evidence is presented)

		- [Regents of UC](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs#:~:text=CURFEW.,the%20campus%20or%20University%20location.) conduct policy for non-affiliates 

			- 100001.B. ""University Property" means *buildings* and grounds that are operated by, or under the control of, the Regents of the University of California

	- They organize their own protests on campus and they attend protests they oppose

		- They are aware of what's going on somehow

		- [Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/65093f0232032a4edc39b4f9/1695104770978/A+Resolution+In+Favor+of+Equalized+Access+to+UCLA+for+Non-Commerical+Speech+Events%3B+Specifically+in+Regards+to+SJP.pdf) in response states "Muslim women were verbally harassed and physically assaulted on November 6th
		by individuals protesting the NJSP conference"

## Protest

- Lack of preparedness: aggression happening days before April 30th

	- David Myers present at protest during escalating tension on the *Sunday before* Tuesday, April 30th [article](https://forward.com/opinion/608479/ucla-violence-campus-protests/)

		- [Protest timeline](https://alexiepogue.com/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/) 
			
			- Skirmishes and violent incidents happening days before April 30th

			- Large counter-protester groups congregated 

- Policy failures 

	- No guidance

		- "The univerisity has not previously called the encampment unlawful or unauthorized" [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/block-indicates-potential-consequences-for-protesters-condemns-campus-aggression)

	- No supervision 

		- "We will not leave" statement by UC Divest in [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/block-indicates-potential-consequences-for-protesters-condemns-campus-aggression)

			- IG [statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6aTBAhLoOl/?hl=en&img_index=1)

	- Weak response, too little too late

		- Block sent an email at 5:04 p.m. on April 30th [DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/block-indicates-potential-consequences-for-protesters-condemns-campus-aggression)


	- Vague policy measures instead of proper crowd control 

		- Totally cryptic flyer largely directed at non-affiliates

		- Blocks email essentially took a policy stance rather than laying out authoritative directives and reasoning behind it

			- Opened the door for "interpretation" of the email as a university position---ie the university's opinion, this was totally confusing 

			- Clearly the administration did not understand or convey the urgency of the matter 






## Efforts at reform 

- Columbia color codes campus climate; no longer allows non-affiliates access [article](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/08/10/columbia-again-restrict-access-to-campus#:~:text=10%2C%202024-,Columbia%20will%20require%20a%20university%20ID%20to%20access%20campus%20starting,said%20of%20the%20Columbia%20campus)
