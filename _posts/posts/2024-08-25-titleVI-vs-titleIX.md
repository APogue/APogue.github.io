What is mandatory with respect to Title IX and the CaRE Act? What is mandatory with respect to Title VI? How are the resolution agreements going beyond? Can this ultimately be 



### Campus SaVE Act requires training and annual compliance reporting wrt sexual harassment and violence 

- [SaVE Act website](https://campussaveact.org/) 

	- "Most higher education institutions—including community colleges and vocational schools—must educate students, faculty, and staff on the prevention of rape, acquaintance rape, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking."

	- History

		- 2001 revised sexual harassment guidance to include employee training---"[S]chools need to ensure that employees are trained so that those with authority to address harassment know how to respond appropriately, and other responsible employees know that they are obligated to report harassment to appropriate school officials."

		- 2011 April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter---"Noting that sexual assault had become an epidemic on college campuses, OCR reiterated that Title IX guarantees all students an education free from sexual harassment and violence. OCR also recommended that"all schools implement preventive education programs" as part of their orientation programs for new students, faculty, and staff.

			"These programs should include a discussion of what constitutes sexual harassment and sexual violence, the school's policies and disciplinary procedures, and the consequences of violating these policies.""

		- 2013 Campus SaVE Act---"Amended the Clery Act to mandate extensive "primary prevention and awareness programs" regarding sexual misconduct and related offenses."

			- "FINANCIAL AID REQUIRES TRAINING---
				An amendment to the Clery Act, the Campus Save Act applies to all postsecondary institutions that participate in federal student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965,"

				- "If your institution publishes an Annual Security Report under the Clery Act, you must offer training."

		- 2014 reporting requirement---"Schools must report compliance with the Campus Save Act in their Annual Security Reports."

	- It makes sense to protect students, but with respect to denied access to an education Title VI and Title IX go much farther

#### UCLA Reports

- Title IX is largely committed to SVSH on college campuses (opinion based on experience and what I'm seeing)

- [UCLA 2023 Clery Report](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/2023-clery-report)

	- P. 34-44 "Sexual Assault Prevention"

	- Pp. 44-99 "Title IX Reporting"---"In accordance with the SVSH Policy, any person may make a report,
	including anonymously, of sexual harassment, sexual violence (sexual
	assault, relationship violence, stalking, or sexual exploitation), or other
	conduct prohibited by the SVSH Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, or to
	any Responsible Employee. The report shall be forwarded to the Title IX
	Officer. "

	- P. 105-106 "Violence Against Women Act"

	- Pp. 106-110 "Hate Crime Definitions" 

		- Not much here compared to SaVE Act & Title IX obligations 

	- All of the above seems to pertain to "crime" prevention, compliance, reporting; although overall, Title IX training went into relationship abuse and other forms of coercive conduct, etc. that would prevent a reasonable person from access to their education but would not be considered a "crime" per se. This can and should be expanded to similar behavior that occurs between anyone, not just people in social relationships. 

	- The "crime" aspects of this wrt prevention, compliance, reporting should absolutely apply to non-affiliates conduct on campus.
