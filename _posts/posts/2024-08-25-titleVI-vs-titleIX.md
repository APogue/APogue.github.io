	- When do pervasive, derogatory opinions become "actionable speech or conduct"

		- How do educational institutions balance their Title IX obligations with individuals’ First Amendment rights?
OCR has consistently reaffirmed that the Federal civil rights laws it enforces protect students from prohibited discrimination, including unlawful harassment, and are not intended to restrict expressive activities or speech protected under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.

			Schools can protect students from verbal harassment without running afoul of students’ and staff First Amendment rights. For instance, in a situation where the First Amendment prohibits a public university from restricting the rights of students to express persistent and pervasive derogatory opinions about a particular sex, the university can instead meet its obligation by, among other steps, communicating a rejection of stereotypical, derogatory opinions and ensuring that competing views are heard. Similarly, educational institutions can establish a campus culture that is welcoming and respectful of the diversity of all students and institute campus climate checks to assess the effectiveness of the school’s efforts to ensure that it is free from harassment. Schools can also encourage students on all sides of an issue to express disagreement over ideas or beliefs in a respectful manner. Schools should be alert to take more targeted responsive action when speech crosses over into direct threats or actionable speech or conduct.

- [UCLA Title IX Office](https://equity.ucla.edu/education/mandatory-trainings/t9-sexual-violence-sexual-harassment-training/)

	- "The Title IX Office ensures compliance with Title IX Federal law. A component of the law requires Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment training for all community members. The Title IX Office offers training to the UCLA community on conduct prohibited by Title IX and the UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment policy."

	- Can't find explicitly that "training" is required for students, but the policies below may equate to "training"

	- [Prevention training](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/202107-qa-titleix.pdf) (Q3) for students may not actually be required. UCLA may be misinforming with respect to "sexual violence and sexual harassment" training being a Title IX requirement

		- This explains why many rights covered by Title IX, like protections against gender discrimination, *are not part of the "Title IX" training we receive* 

		- This is extremely confusing because it is called "Title IX Training," but Title IX only encourages training, what specifically motivates the label given? What specifically is mandated by Title IX wrt having rights be known and the communication of policies? 

			- Is it enough to have student policies posted on a website to read? Don't think it is, I would like to find the portion of the law that communicates this because for some reason, it is enough to have all other policies "made available" but not necessarily "made known" to students. 

			- The goal is to align Title VI (and gender + LGBTQ+ discrimination) with Title IX

				- Rights are communicated and students made literate/competent with respect to these rights

	- Ensure that schools communicate their nondiscrimination policies and procedures.
	The final regulations require schools to clearly and effectively inform key people, including
	students, employees, and applicants, of their nondiscrimination policies and procedures.

	- Rescinded but the below should still be applicable


	- Every School Must Have And Distribute A Policy Against Sex Discrimination

		- Title IX requires that each school publish a policy that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its education programs and activities.  This notice must be widely distributed and available on an on-going basis.
		The policy must state that inquiries concerning Title IX may be referred to the school’s Title IX coordinator or to OCR.

	- Every School Must Have A Title IX Coordinator

		- Every school must designate at least one employee who is responsible for coordinating the school’s compliance with Title IX.  This person is sometimes referred to as the Title IX coordinator.  Schools must notify all students and employees of the name or title and contact information of the Title IX coordinator.
		The coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing all complaints of sex discrimination and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.


	- Every School Must Have And Make Known Procedures For Students To File Complaints Of Sex Discrimination.

		- Title IX requires schools to adopt and publish grievance procedures for students to file complaints of sex discrimination, including complaints of sexual harassment or sexual violence.  Schools can use general disciplinary procedures to address complaints of sex discrimination.  But all procedures must provide for prompt and equitable resolution of sex discrimination complaints.


- [Brief Overview of Key Provisions of the DOE's 2024 Title IX Final Rule](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-final-rule-summary.pdf)

	- "Clarifies requirements for designating a Title IX Coordinator, adopting and publishing nondiscrimination policies and
grievance procedures, and providing a notice of nondiscrimination. (§ 106.8(a)–(c)). Clarifies which individuals a
recipient must train on Title IX and provides requirements for such training, which vary based on an individual’s role.
(§ 106.8(d)). Requires a recipient to protect the rights of parties who are students with disabilities. (§ 106.8(e)).
Clarifies which records a recipient must maintain for at least seven years. (§ 106.8(f))."

	- Administrative requirements are on pg 250

	- Training requirements are on pg 267

		- "Background: Section 106.8(d)(1) requires all employees to be trained on the recipient’s
	obligation to address sex discrimination in its education program or activity, the scope of
	conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including the definition of “sex-based
	harassment,” and all applicable notification and information requirements under §§ 106.40(b)(2)
	and 106.44.""

		- Refers to commenters' arguments against training and lists reasons it supports mandatory training. Among these reasons are additional training shouldn't present significant add-ons with respect to resources for preexisting training infrastructure. 

		- This is a good reason to have a Title VI add-on to Title IX infrastructure 

### Notes

- It looks like with Title IX, based on legal obligations to inform students of their rights, a literacy component is provided. With respect to Title VI, is there a legal obligation to inform students of their rights? Or is there only a legal obligation to "protect" students' rights? If part of that protection mechanism relies on the student then, like Title IX, they should be made literate and informed of their rights.
