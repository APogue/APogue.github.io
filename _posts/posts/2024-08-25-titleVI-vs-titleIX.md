### Title IX Final Rule

- "The U.S. Department of Education (Department) amends the regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). The purpose of these amendments is to better align the Title IX regulatory requirements with Title IX's nondiscrimination mandate. These amendments clarify the scope and application of Title IX and the obligations of recipients of Federal financial assistance from the Department, including elementary schools, secondary schools, postsecondary institutions, and other recipients (referred to below as “recipients” or “schools”) to provide an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including through responding to incidents of sex discrimination. These final regulations will enable all recipients to meet their obligations to comply with Title IX while providing them with appropriate discretion and flexibility to account for variations in school size, student populations, and administrative structures."

### Title IX 

- There is a discrepancy with respect to how they're enforced

- They key to Title IX is

	- Centralized oversight and reporting body: Title IX Coordinator

		- [Section 106.8(a): Title IX Coordinator](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-931) 

			- "Title IX Coordinator's role as outlined in the proposed regulations, including with respect to duties contemplated by proposed §§ 106.40(b), 106.44(b), 106.44(f), 106.44(k), 106.45(d)(4)(iii), and 106.45(h)(3)."

	- [Unified nondiscrimination policy, grievance procedures, and notice of nondiscrimination](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-944)

		- The notice of nondiscrimination, 106.8(c)(1), must be published in accordance with 106.8(c)(2), the [notification of rights](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-979)

			- [The notice](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-953) "notifies individuals of rights protected by Title IX and how to make a report or a complaint under Title IX."

		- [Final Rule Section 106.46 & 106.44(k): Framework for Grievance Procedures](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1777)

	- [Final Rule 106.8(d): Obligation to train all employees](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1013)

		- How do you close the gap in reporting awareness? 

		- "The Department has modified § 106.44(c)(2)(ii)(B) to state that one of the options for Category 2 employees is to provide the contact information of the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to make a complaint of sex discrimination to any person who provides the employee with information about conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX or this part." [Link](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1289)

			- No one is made aware that employees formally trained in Title IX crises response

	- [Final Rule Section 106.45(b)(2) Prohibition on Conflicts of Interest and Bias](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-2009)

		- "The Department explains these anti-bias provisions in greater detail in the discussion of §§ 106.8(d), 106.44(k)(4), and 106.45(b)(2)"

		- The school took a biased position wrt incidents involving pro-Palestinian students

	- [There is no Title IX obligation to train students](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1012), however, there was a need for prevention training that was recognized by the [Campus SaVE Act](https://campussaveact.org/) 

		- What is the story there? 

		- It is clear that the university is just trying fulfill a legal obligation---Title IX education consisted of several prevention training modules, with link clicks to long documents in between. These long documents explained our rights. But there were no clear messages stating, "if you are unsure whether an incident may have occurred go to your Title IX Coordinator." They (deliberately?) buried the lede when really clarity and an explanation of rights can be reiterated by the Title IX office should someone need it. The 1st requirement, above everything else, is the students need to know reflexively that the coordinator is there. 

			- "First, encouraging reporting and facilitating complaints of sex discrimination is a critical part of a recipient's duty to effectuate Title IX's nondiscrimination mandate...and the risk of increased litigation, if any, is justified because, as explained in greater detail above, mandating that complaints be made in writing discourages individuals from making complaints, in contravention of the purpose of Title IX to eliminate all discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

	- Coverage goes on and on, from constructive notice [jurisdiction](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-797) to what constitutes a complaint [1](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-424) & [2](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-389) to a [legal obligation to respond](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1130) to [identity disclosure](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1662) to [recordkeeping](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1058)

	
- Title VI designed by the "recipient" 

	- Notification of rights do not go as far

	- Optional training (freshman orientation)

	- Confusing reporting mechanism

	- No legal obligation to respond to reports 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is mandatory with respect to Title IX and the CaRE Act? What is mandatory with respect to Title VI? How are the resolution agreements going beyond? Can this ultimately be 



### Campus SaVE Act requires training and annual compliance reporting wrt sexual harassment and violence 

- [SaVE Act website](https://campussaveact.org/) 

	- "Most higher education institutions—including community colleges and vocational schools—must educate students, faculty, and staff on the prevention of rape, acquaintance rape, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking."

	- History

		- 2001 revised sexual harassment guidance to include employee training---"[S]chools need to ensure that employees are trained so that those with authority to address harassment know how to respond appropriately, and other responsible employees know that they are obligated to report harassment to appropriate school officials."

		- 2011 April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter---"Noting that sexual assault had become an epidemic on college campuses, OCR reiterated that Title IX guarantees all students an education free from sexual harassment and violence. OCR also recommended that"all schools implement preventive education programs" as part of their orientation programs for new students, faculty, and staff.

			"These programs should include a discussion of what constitutes sexual harassment and sexual violence, the school's policies and disciplinary procedures, and the consequences of violating these policies.""

		- 2013 Campus SaVE Act---"Amended the Clery Act to mandate extensive "primary prevention and awareness programs" regarding sexual misconduct and related offenses."

			- "FINANCIAL AID REQUIRES TRAINING---
				An amendment to the Clery Act, the Campus Save Act applies to all postsecondary institutions that participate in federal student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965,"

				- "If your institution publishes an Annual Security Report under the Clery Act, you must offer training."

		- 2014 reporting requirement---"Schools must report compliance with the Campus Save Act in their Annual Security Reports."

	- It makes sense to protect students, but with respect to denied access to an education Title VI and Title IX go much farther

#### UCLA Reports

- Title IX is largely committed to SVSH on college campuses (opinion based on experience and what I'm seeing)

	- [Title IX Regulations FAQs](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/file/ff9b59bd-21ce-48df-8fc1-d5d26eda55bb)

	- [UCLA Title IX Office](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/)

- [UCLA Public Accountability Report](https://ucla.app.box.com/s/eyri3lej5htfl7uwkv7huhp9o8y3revo)

- [UCLA 2023 Clery Report](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/2023-clery-report)

	- P. 34-44 "Sexual Assault Prevention"

	- Pp. 44-99 "Title IX Reporting"---"In accordance with the SVSH Policy, any person may make a report,
	including anonymously, of sexual harassment, sexual violence (sexual
	assault, relationship violence, stalking, or sexual exploitation), or other
	conduct prohibited by the SVSH Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, or to
	any Responsible Employee. The report shall be forwarded to the Title IX
	Officer."

	- P. 105-106 "Violence Against Women Act"

	- Pp. 106-110 "Hate Crime Definitions" 

		- Not much here compared to SaVE Act & Title IX obligations 

	- All of the above seems to pertain to "crime" prevention, compliance, reporting; although overall, Title IX training went into relationship abuse and other forms of coercive conduct, etc. that would prevent a reasonable person from access to their education but would not be considered a "crime" per se. This can and should be expanded to similar behavior that occurs between anyone, not just people in social relationships. 

	- The "crime" aspects of this wrt prevention, compliance, reporting should absolutely apply to non-affiliate conduct on campus. 

### Title IX 

#### UCLA Title IX 

- "Title IX was enacted in 1972 as a code of federal regulation. It is enforced by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the United States Department of Education. The University of California Systemwide Title IX office constructs policy in compliance of state and federal law uniformly across the UC system. Title IX prohibitive conduct as outlined in the SVSH Policy include: Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, Relationship Violence, Stalking, Gender discrimination, Gender identity discrimination, Gender Expression discrimination, Sexual Orientation discrimination, Pregnancy discrimination, Retaliation, Indecent Exposure, Statutory rape, Invasion of Sexual Privacy, and Failure to Comply with an Order."

	- [UC SVSH Policy](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/file/50c2002a-0bbf-40d4-bff8-636b95de48ee) includes all of the above

	- [Training requirements](https://equity.ucla.edu/education/mandatory-trainings/t9-sexual-violence-sexual-harassment-training/#student) and relevant policies 

		- [Training required annually](https://sexualharassment.ucla.edu/education-training/undergraduate-students), failure to complete training results in registration hold on account 

		- ["Mandatory civil rights training" by EDI@UCLA](https://equity.ucla.edu/edi-ucla/education/) simply leads to Title IX training

#### OCR and Title IX

- [DOE Title IX Final Rule](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-final-title-ix-regulations-providing-vital-protections-against-sex-discrimination)

	- "The rule clarifies the steps a school must take to protect students, employees, and applicants from discrimination based on pregnancy or related conditions."

	- "The final rule promotes accountability by requiring schools to take prompt and effective action to end any sex discrimination in their education programs or activities, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects."

- [FACT SHEET: U.S. Department of Education’s 2024 Title IX Final Rule Overview](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-final-rule-factsheet.pdf)
	
	- "Ensure that schools communicate their nondiscrimination policies and procedures---
	The final regulations require schools to clearly and effectively inform key people, including
	students, employees, and applicants, of their nondiscrimination policies and procedures."

	- "Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decisionmakers, and facilitators of an informal
	resolution process must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants
	or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent."

	- Administrative requirements § 106.8

		- [Compliance responsibilities and Coordinator roles](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07915/p-1173)

		- § 106.8(a), Designation of a Title IX Coordinator

			- P. 250, " Some commenters supported proposed § 106.8(a) because it would centralize the
	recipient’s compliance efforts, ensure accountability and efficiency, and minimize internal
	conflicts and confusion that could delay compliance."

		- § 106.8(c)(2), Providing a notice of nondiscrimination

			- P. 267,"The final regulations’ posting requirement is necessary so that students, their parents or
	guardians, or other legal representatives as appropriate, employees, and others who seek to
	participate in a recipient’s education program or activity have access to information about Title
	IX whenever they might need it. Section 106.8(c)(2) may be broader than other State or Federal
	notice requirements that relate only to employees because a recipient needs to reach the entire
	school community, including those who join midway through or for only a limited part of the
	school year. Although recipients may be subject to requirements under other Federal or State
	laws, the Department has determined that the requirements in § 106.8(c)(2) are necessary to
	effectuate Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate. While the Department agrees that Title IX does
	not itself require a recipient to issue notices mandated under any other law, including State laws,
	it is unnecessary to address obligations under other laws in the final Title IX regulations. "

		- § 106.8(d), Clarifies which individuals a 
		recipient must train on Title IX and provides requirements for such training, which vary based on an individual’s role.

			- P. 267, Background: Section 106.8(d)(1) requires all employees to be trained on the recipient’s
	obligation to address sex discrimination in its education program or activity, the scope of
	conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including the definition of “sex-based
	harassment,” and all applicable notification and information requirements under §§ 106.40(b)(2)
	and 106.44. Additionally, § 106.8(d)(2) requires all investigators, decisionmakers, and other
	persons responsible for implementing the recipient’s grievance procedures or who have the
	authority to modify or terminate supportive measures to also be trained on the recipient’s
	obligations under § 106.44; the recipient’s grievance procedures under § 106.45, and if
	applicable § 106.46; how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at
	issue, conflicts of interest, and bias; and the meaning and application of the term “relevant” in
	relation to questions and evidence, and the types of evidence that are impermissible regardless of
	relevance under § 106.45, and if applicable § 106.46.

		- "The new regulations set a higher bar for institutional compliance by requiring a response upon receipt of notice of possible sex discrimination under Title IX."

	- Compliance (Background)

		Resolution agreements- P. 91, "Moreover, in the context of administrative enforcement, a recipient must be given notice and an opportunity to come into compliance before the termination of funding. 20 U.S.C. 1682.
		Indeed, the Department’s administrative enforcement investigations generally result in
		agreements with the recipient to take action that would bring them into compliance. Thus, if the
		Department receives a complaint about severe or pervasive harassment, and its investigation
		confirms the allegations in that complaint, the Department will bring this conduct to the attention
		of the recipient, and to discuss and determine appropriate corrective measures with the
		recipient’s input.""

- [2020 Q & A on Title IX 2020 Amendments](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/202107-qa-titleix.pdf)

	- P. 3, "The Department’s Title IX regulations were first issued in 1975, reissued in 1980,
	and then amended after that, including in 2006 and 2020. Prior to 2020, the regulations set out
	requirements under Title IX for educational programs and activities that receive federal financial
	aid, but they did not include specific requirements related to sexual harassment. Instead, OCR
	had several guidance documents in place to assist schools in understanding how OCR interpreted
	the Department’s Title IX regulations. The 2020 amendments added specific, legally binding steps
	that schools must take in response to notice of alleged sexual harassment."


- Who does the Title IX Coordinator report to? What are the obligations with respect to Title IX reporting? 

	- OCR should want to know whether a school is doing a good job based on the submission of complete reports periodically; they should not wait for complaints filed to OCR as evidence that Title IX compliance is inadequate. 

	- OCR is just a reaction mechanism to ensure compliance? Not an oversight body? 

		- Dear Colleague Letters (suggestions)

		- Resolution Letters and Agreements (receive complaints, conduct investigations and hold institutions accountable)
