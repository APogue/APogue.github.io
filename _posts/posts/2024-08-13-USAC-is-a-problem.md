Thesis: Correlation with the conflict in Gaza is not necessarily causation. 

""While many of the demands of pro-Palestinian groups may coincide with the ongoing conflict in Gaza, this correlation does not imply that the war directly causes these demands. Instead, the rhetoric among these groups often aligns more closely with the longstanding anti-Israel doctrine promoted by Hamas, suggesting that these demands are rooted in broader ideological beliefs rather than being solely a reaction to the current conflict."

This way, you clearly separate the timing of events from the underlying ideological consistency that might be driving the rhetoric."

 			- The points listed 

 				- "Addresses longstanding issues related to Israel's...treatment of Palestinian's more generally"

 				- "Given this broader critique...it is likely that the "list" of entities to be boycotted would extend beyond the Gaza conflict...encompassing entities across Israel and its broader economic and political structures."
