Thesis: Correlation with the conflict in Gaza is not necessarily causation. 

""While many of the demands of pro-Palestinian groups may coincide with the ongoing conflict in Gaza, this correlation does not imply that the war directly causes these demands. Instead, the rhetoric among these groups often aligns more closely with the longstanding anti-Israel doctrine promoted by Hamas, suggesting that these demands are rooted in broader ideological beliefs rather than being solely a reaction to the current conflict."

This way, you clearly separate the timing of events from the underlying ideological consistency that might be driving the rhetoric."


 ## Background and context

 - The situation in Palestine has been on the Council's radar for a while 

 	- [Myers opposes](https://dailybruin.com/2014/05/23/submission-usac-ethics-statement-exacerbates-israeli-palestinian-situation) a proposed pledge (2014) that would ban students from taking trips to Israel sponsored by certain groups 

- Case of antisemitism 

 	- Reemergence of what the author believes is the "Jewish Question", [TDB](https://dailybruin.com/2015/03/09/submission-ucla-campus-must-take-action-to-address-anti-semitism)

- [Resolutions](https://www.usac.ucla.edu/documents/resolutions) in the past have condemned antisemitism 

	- "[A Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/65093b574272311736b89fac/1695103831148/A+Resolution+In+Support+of+Jewish+Students+Amidst+Rising+Antisemitism.pdf) in Support of Jewish Students Amidst Rising Antisemitism"

	- [Efforts](https://dailybruin.com/2018/11/18/national-students-for-justice-in-palestine-conference-goes-on-despite-on-campus-protest) to suppress speech in the past have been answered by USAC

		- [Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/65093f0232032a4edc39b4f9/1695104770978/A+Resolution+In+Favor+of+Equalized+Access+to+UCLA+for+Non-Commerical+Speech+Events%3B+Specifically+in+Regards+to+SJP.pdf) for equal access 

- Shortly after Oct 7th 

 	- Protected speech by non-USAC affiliated student groups 

 		- SJP

 			- [Mission](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/90)

 			- [Letter](https://www.instagram.com/p/CygsqBTPKsQ/?hl=en&img_index=1) to the regents 

 			- [Al-Aqsa Flood](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17bwsih/when_did_it_become_acceptable_to_openly/)


 		- JVP 

 			- [Mission](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/3992)

 				- How do they define "Zionism?"

 			- [Reaction](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZwV-dO3Ue/?img_index=1) to Oct 7th 


 	- Protected speech by USAC affiliated student groups 

 		- CAC

 			- [Mission](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/623)

 				- Add their mission of "accessibility to all students?", this may just be fluff that will overburden the point with thoughts of what they "should" be doing rather than what they "must" do

 			- [Position](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMSRCuSlAR/?hl=en&img_index=1) on Oct 7th

 				- "River to the Sea"

 				- "Honoring Palestinians on the front lines"

 	- USAC February Resolution

 		- [Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/21/usac-passes-resolution-endorsing-boycott-divest-and-sanctions-movement)

 		- [USAC Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/663f458d5f90ea7b2468c313/1715422605926/resolution.2024-02-20.A+Resolution+to+Boycott+and+Divest+from+Apartheid,+Ethnic+Cleansing,+and+Genocide.pdf)

 			- The points listed 

 				- "Addresses longstanding issues related to Israel's...treatment of Palestinian's more generally"

 				- "Given this broader critique...it is likely that the "list" of entities to be boycotted would extend beyond the Gaza conflict...encompassing entities across Israel and its broader economic and political structures."

			- Resolution was sponsored by Verdugo, 10-3 vote to pass on 2-20

- The political climate at this point, given the rhetorical positions of SJP and CAC, and the desire to target Israel more broadly, resembles the political positions of Hamas 

	- This is still "okay," if they want to side with Hamas this is protected 

	- Define the political position of Hamas

		- The state of Israel is a "Zionist Project"

		- [Propaganda document](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PDF.pdf)

		- [General Principles and Policies](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/hamas-2017.pdf)

- Is Tsives, who is widely publicized for being "attention hungry" and a right-wing media device, the only one who feels this way? 


















protest hate- discrimination CAC triangles on their site

JVP will and will not work with - indicates discrimination, because the "political" messages of JVP and SJP do not "align", but JVP does work with SJP
