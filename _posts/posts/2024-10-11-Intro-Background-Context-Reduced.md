## Introduction

- Draw a connection between what is happening on the national level and UCLA: current antisemitic activity 
	
	- Graffiti 

	- Symbolism at the UCLA protest 

	- Lavie Levi's statement

- Opening incident: The protest itself---the intention was to bring UCLA to the table but nothing productive came of the week-long encampment, rallies and protests. The only lasting result---serious incidents involving discrimination and violence 

	- Eli Tsives blocked from entering an area of campus (taken on video)

		- He made a point to emphasize "that he pays tuition"

	- Physical barriers were also in place to keep so-called "Zionists" out

		- Masked non-affiliates with weapons attacked the encampment

- Transitional statement

	- There was clear rule breaking on both sides, so why did UCLA allow it to continue for days until things got completely out of hand? 

- Thesis statement: A lack of proper oversight by UCLA administration has led to problematic incidents involving discrimination and violence
