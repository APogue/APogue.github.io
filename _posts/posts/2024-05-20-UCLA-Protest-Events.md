Just notes:
As a graduate student at UCLA, I complete Title IX training every year. It is a chore and I always avoid doing it (until I get an administrative hold on my Bruin account). When I have no choice but to do it, I’m ultimately glad because it has always been beneficial to me. Title IX training explains your rights and who you can report any incidents of sexual harassment or misconduct to. The most helpful part of the training is really helping to address *when* a scenario arises that is not normal or healthy. It’s difficult to prove to ourselves and others when we are being gaslighted, and so we may not trust our own judgement. It also helps us be prepared when we are faced with these scenarios, so we are ready to either help ourselves or others. Often times it takes a couple practice tries before the proper protective measures become reflexive, the videos present students with hypotheticals, demonstrating how social situations might become toxic. It then instructs students on the best course of action given the scenario. It teaches you to parse the fundamentals of each situation that might otherwise be relegated to our subconscious. “Here is coercive behavior, here is threatening behavior, here is someone trying to sabotage you, here we might be more considerate, here is a chance to support and show understanding”. Young minds need guidance, rather than the emotional burden of trial and error. The videos don’t just help potential victims, but it helps potential perpetrators of Title IX misconduct in giving some perspective and educating individuals on what misconduct is, how others view it, and the repercussions that follow. For everyone, our judgement goes from hazy and nebulous, where we might only realize hours or weeks later that a situation was unhealthy, to an immediate classifier where one can asses and bin behavior primitives and act according to the preconceived guidance that has been provided.
