### Outline

Will only include the information absolutely necessary to understanding the core data pipeline, funding purposes, funding methods, my approach and why the methodology exposes issues, and the CRO take (maybe at the beginning, maybe at the end). 

- What is UCR 
    - Who is submitting
    - What is it used for
        - Aside from state-level data management and processing which may be different (mandated vs voluntary), this is the nationwide database for crime statistics (fact check that)
    - What methodologies are there for any processing (slight processing I believe, prior to CIUS processing. They fill in data for years considered "incomplete" by some number of months) 
    - SRS and NIBRS switch (take this from CRO)
        - Hierarchy rule
        - Reporting issues continue to affect data integrity, in which years after 2021 did they continue to accept SRS? (and from who? states that are uncertified?)
        - What does the "switch" entail? Once a state is certified is no more SRS data coming in from that state? And only in the 60/40 breakdown are they interacting with SRS agencies? 
- What is JAG
    - What is it used for
    - Methods
        - Concern is for the state-level funding, further breakdowns between SSA and local agencies not considered
        - They use a sliding window containing the 3 most recent years of complete data, they have been using the 2018-2020 window since the 2022 FY (I believe) and through FY 2025 (although that report is unpublished)
        - What is CIUS
            - What constitutes a violent crime? 
            - What constitutes a homicide?
            - What processing methodologies are used? 
- Plots and analysis
    - CDC 
        - Mandatory
        - What constitutes an deadly assault?
        - What processing is used (find methodologies)
    - The line should be between the orange and green, the theoretical maximum assumes total consistency between medical coroners/ME's and police investigations, with a delta from self-defense (inclusive, excluded, respectively). 
    - Other variations are due to IDC-9 to IDC-10 switch, different conclusions between medical and police with respect to cause of death, or whether the cause could not be determined, which the CDC would coded as "underdetermined" (and the police unknown?)
    - Regardless, empirically close alignment with the CDC is achieved in some states (or there could be more backend comms and collaboration between local agencies and coroners) 
    - What I would consider a "healthy reporting channel" versus one that's problematic (Texas vs MS)
    - In addition to the frozen 2018-2020 window (which they've used exactly how many times?) Exacly how many times did JAG use the year 2018 to calculate funding?
- CRO take on the issue (this is where you talk about why there seems to be issues with the switch)
    - Why is the SRS to NIBRS data switch a problem? 
    - What are the data implications without targeted infrastructure funding
- My take on the issue
    - Why is the way the statistics are reported by the UCR/NIBRS/CIUS an issue?
        - They are lumping critical reporting gaps in with low-priority gaps and citing a single, nationwide coverage statistic
    - Has UCR met their reporting coverage sufficiency threshold in the years 2022, 2023, and 2024 under the NIBRS system? Is this the data they used and submitted for FY 2026? 
        - MS has gone up in reporting coverage but the error has increased since the switch (lag?)
            - Is the state certified but agencies are failing to switch? Or as more agencies enter the NIBRS others are leaving SRS? (lag). 
        - What are the implications with respect to funding and reporting if they used the NIBRS data? Or if they choose to use it in the future without targeted funding for the switch?
