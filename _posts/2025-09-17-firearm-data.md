### CDC WONDER Firearm Data for a Few States Over time

According to the CDC, firearm-related deaths include unintentional discharges (W32–W34), suicides (X72–X74), homicides (X93–X95), deaths of undetermined intent (Y22–Y24), legal intervention (Y35.0), and terrorism involving firearms (rare, U01.4).[^6]

### Rand's Estimate of State-Level Household Firearm Ownership

The HFR line is RAND’s estimate of the proportion of adults living in a household with a firearm in a given state and year. The data is modeled from surveys and proxy records (firearm suicides, hunting licenses, Guns & Ammo subscriptions, background checks) rather than direct records as in previous plots.[^5]
