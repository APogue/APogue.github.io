## Variables

- **G ∈ {0,1}** — identity group  
  (1 = advantaged group, 0 = comparison group)

- **V ∈ {low, high, max}** — visibility

- **A ∈ {0,1}** — specific, actor‑targeted action (imposes concrete sanctions, identifies perpetrator group, or names targeted group)

- **C ∈ {0,1}** — institutional communication (any outward comms)

- **P ∈ {0,1}** — protective content within communication  
  (naming targeted group, specific warnings, concrete protective guidance)

- **S** — severity (ordinal; used as a control)

- **R_cost** — reputational cost of specific communication

---

## Assumptions

1. **Monotonicity:** higher visibility (V) weakly increases probability of A and C.  
2. **No reverse causation:** V is defined independently of A and C.  
3. **Reputational cost = 0** in Lemma 3 is established for the specific incident.  
4. **Reputation is visibility-linked:** institutions typically experience reputational pressure when V is high.

---

## Core Chain

- **V → C**: higher visibility produces more comms (observed).  
- **V → R_cost**: visibility raises reputational stakes (assumed).  
- **V → G**: visibility is not evenly distributed; it clusters on one group (empirical).
- **S → A**: in principle, higher severity should drive more specific action — but this channel collapses (Lemma 1)   
- **S → V**: severity can raise visibility, but this link is inconsistent and group-dependent (empirical).  

**Implication:** If V is the driver, you cannot separate whether the institution is communicating for **reputation** (PR logic) or for **group** (non-neutral).

## Lemma 1: Severity vs. Specific Action (Part I: Specific Action Analysis (Unconditional))

**Question:**  
What action is taken to address bad actors? If no specific action is taken, specific communication may serve as action. This study determines what action was taken, regardless of incident visibility. 

**Hypothesis:**  
- **Within groups:** ∂Pr(A)/∂S ≈ 0 for both groups — increased severity does not drive meaningful increases in specific action.  

- **Between groups:** 
  - Pr(A | G=1) > Pr(A | G=0) across severity levels.

**Observed Pattern:**  
- **G=1 (advantaged group):** Some reactive measures, some symbolic specificity (e.g., initiating review, naming antisemitism, emotional framing).
- **G=0 (comparison group):** No specificity at all — environmental measures, responses limited to generic safety concerns and procedural language (e.g., "we are reviewing safety protocols," "the situation is being monitored").

**Critical Finding:**  
The institution largely failed to sanction bad actors for either group, even as severity persisted. **Only G=1** received symbolic recognition of targeted harm.

**Implication:**  
This shows two layers of failure:  
1. The institution's systematic failure to identify and sanction bad actors allowed a hostile environment to persist for both groups.  
2. In the absence of specific action, a discriminatory refusal to acknowledge protected-class harm for G=0 existed.

## Lemma 2: Communication Tracks Visibility (Part II: Communication Analysis)

Given that meaningful action conditioned on severity fails systematically, we now examine communication patterns conditional on visibility.

**Given:**  

- Pr(C=1 | V=high) ≈ 1, Pr(C=1 | V=low) ≈ 0  
- Pr(V=high | G=1) > Pr(V=high | G=0)

**Then:**  

- Pr(C=1 | G=1) > Pr(C=1 | G=0)

**Interpretation note:**  
This only shows that **communication frequency** tracks visibility.  
Since R_cost rises with V, comms *look like* they are serving reputation.  
But in high-visibility scenarios, we cannot distinguish whether comms are driven by **reputation** or by **group identity**.  

---

## Lemma 3: The Chain-Breaking Outlier

In the maximum-visibility, maximum-severity case, where reputational cost = 0, the reputation channel predicts protective content (P=1 if any criterion is met in the same communication instance (naming, specific warning, or concrete guidance)).  

**Setup (maximum case):**  
- V = maximum (highest-visibility incident)  
- S = maximum (most severe: mob attack)  
- R_cost = 0 (condemning mob violence was reputationally safe)

**Observed:**  
- C = 1 (they communicated)  
- P = 0 (no protective content)

**Logic:**  
- If the reputation channel were operative, R_cost=0 with V=max should yield P=1
  - **Reputation channel (PR logic):** V → R_cost → P 
- Observed P=0 eliminates the reputation channel.  
- The only remaining determinant is group identity (G).  
  -  **Group channel (bias):** V → G → P
- Given X = {V = max, S = max, R_cost = 0},  
  equivalently, with X held constant:

G ⟶ P   (non-neutral).

---

### Corollary (Practical Test)

Let X = {V = max, S = max, R_cost = 0}.  
Define  
Δ = Pr(P=1 | G=1, X) − Pr(P=1 | G=0, X).  

If Δ > 0 with narrow confidence intervals, then protective communication is **group-dependent, not reputation-dependent**. This isolates non-neutral communication in protective content.

## Lemma 4: High-Stakes Comms and Mitigation Duty

Building on Lemmas 1–3, which show how action, communication, and protective content operate, Lemma 4 isolates a further obligation: when hostile actors are known to be reactive to comms, the institution must mitigate before speaking in high-stakes channels.

**The argument:**
1. Past incidents showed hostile actors were reactive to comms (established knowledge)
2. University did not remove/mitigate these actors (M=0)
3. University issued high-stakes comms anyway
4. Therefore: They knowingly accepted the risk of *triggering hostile actors*

**This IS deliberate indifference because:**
- They had actual knowledge of the risk (from past reactivity)
- They chose to act despite that knowledge
- They had alternatives (mitigate first, or don't communicate)

## Legal Parallel

This is like:
- A school knows certain students react violently to announcements about rival gangs
- School doesn't remove those students
- School makes inflammatory announcement anyway
- = Deliberate indifference (they knew and chose to risk it)

I don't need to prove violence actually occurred after the announcement - just that they **knew it could** based on past behavior.

**Variables:**  
- **C*** — comms traction (reach/visibility of admin comms, in response to national news, viral rumors, made during a high-stakes situation unfolding in real time)  
- **T_known ∈ {0,1}** — presence of hostile actors (premeditated behavior, coordinated action, motivated by threats to a protected group, repeat presence on campus, and demonstrably reactive to university communications (directly or indirectly))  
- **M ∈ {0,1}** — any institutional mitigation of those threats (ban, sanction, removal, initiation of police investigations, unlawful conduct warning, or deterrence of unlawful behavior through stated preparedness)

**Hypothesis:**  
When hostile actors are known (T_known=1), the institution has a duty to mitigate (M=1).  
If mitigation does not occur (M=0) and the institution nonetheless issues high-traction comms (C*>0), *this demonstrates deliberate indifference: the university acts with knowledge of foreseeable harm while failing to take reasonable preventive steps.*

**Observed:**  
- **T_known = 1** — Kaplan incident revealed organized, hostile actors motivated by group-based animus with repeat campus presence
- **M = 0** — no bans, no sanctions, no removals, no deterrent warnings between Kaplan and April 30
- **C*** = high — April 30 post with 160k views, national-level traction

**Critical Finding:**  
By April 30, the university had months of notice that hostile actors were present and reactive to a communication instance (T_known=1), yet no mitigation occurred (M=0). High-traction comms were then issued into that same environment (C*>0), with known threats unaddressed. This is deliberate indifference: a choice to speak while failing to eliminate a foreseeable risk.*

**Implication:**  
High-stakes comms (C*) cannot be separated from mitigation obligations once hostile actors are known (T_known=1). If M=0, the institution’s choice to continue communicating is not neutral. Mitigation must occur once threats are known. Otherwise, every subsequent comms act compounds risk by signaling to hostile actors that they remain unopposed.

### Corollary (Test Condition)

Let X = {T_known = 1}.  

Define:  
- Success = ∃ incident where M=1 (any mitigation occurs once threats are known)  
- Failure = ∀ incidents, M=0 (no mitigation ever occurs despite knowledge)

If Failure holds while C*>0, the institution demonstrates deliberate indifference: it continues to communicate publicly without ever mitigating known threats.*

## Conclusion

- **Action channel:** A favors G=1, regardless of severity (Lemma 1).  
- **Communication frequency:** C tracks visibility, not severity (Lemma 2).
- **Protective content:** Even when V=max, S=max, and R_cost=0, P=0 for G=0 (Lemma 3).  
- **Mitigation duty:** With T_known=1 and M=0 while (C* > 0) demonstrates deliberate indifference (Lemma 4).
 

**Together these findings show that group identity, not severity or visibility, best predicts some types of institutional behavior — and the absence of mitigation in high-stakes moments demonstrates an example of deliberate indifference.**
