# ðŸ“Š Incident Response Analysis Project

This project documents and analyzes university administrative response to identity-based incidents from 2023â€“2024 using structured data, public sources, and reproducible methods.

## ðŸ§± Folder Purpose

- **`_incidents/`** â€” Contains one Markdown file per incident with YAML front matter for metadata (`incident_id`, `severity_score`, etc.) and a narrative body for summaries
- **`_includes/`** â€” Reusable HTML snippets (e.g., evidence/source lists) used in site rendering
- **`_data/sources.yml`** â€” Canonical list of source metadata (ID, title, type, etc.), referenced by all incident and evidence files
- **`_data/evidence/`** â€” Holds per-incident YAML files that justify variable values using quoted sources
- **`_data/field_definitions`** â€” Master schema for all coded fields, including names, types, and allowed values for structured variables
- **`_protocols/`** â€” Defines project-wide standards for evidence citation, coding workflows, and quote validation (e.g., Critical Source Validation Protocol)
- **`sources/`** â€” Contains raw source documents (PDFs, emails, Daily Bruin articles, screenshots, OCR text)
- **`appendix/`** â€” Used to store final output formats (YAML exports, CSVs, charts) for publication or audit
- **`projects/`** â€” Public-facing project documentation (e.g., method pages, incident lists, field guides)
- **`_layouts/`** â€” Custom Jekyll layout templates that determine how incidents and project pages render on the site

## ðŸ“˜ Content Types

- **Incident pages** â†’ Generated from `_incidents/*.md` using `layout: incident`  
- **Incident index** â†’ Rendered via Liquid loop in `projects/incident-analysis.md`  
- **Sources** â†’ Centralized metadata in `_data/sources.yml`, content in `sources/` folder

---

## âœ… To Add a New Incident

1. Create `INC-XXX.md` in `_incidents/`  
2. Fill out YAML front matter with required fields  
3. Add narrative summary as Markdown body  
4. Update `sources.yml` if new sources were used  
5. Drop new source files in `sources/`  
6. Rebuild site â€” incident auto-appears in index

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodological Integrity

This project is designed for:
- Transparency  
- Replicability  
- Neutral source anchoring (e.g., Daily Bruin as sole inclusion source)

All structured variables (severity, visibility, admin response) are rule-based and consistently coded. Media bias and student narratives are treated as contextual controls, not incident selectors.
