## üìú Inclusion Rule

Any campus-affiliated event between Sept 2023 and June 2024 where:

- (a) identity-based harm, exclusion, or discrimination was alleged  
- (b) a symbolic or physical protest, walkout, or occupation occurred on or near university grounds
- (c) time, place, and manner (TPM) violations or campus safety failures were documented or alleged

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:

- Must be scoped to clear incident-ness (a moment in time, impact, admin attention, or clear escalation)

      <li>{{ keyword }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
