This project documents and analyzes UCLA's administrative response to identity-based incidents from 2023â€“2024 using structured data, public sources, and reproducible methods.

## ðŸ§± Folder Purpose

- **`_incidents/`** â€” Stores structured incident files with consistent metadata (`incident_id`, `severity_score`, etc.)  
- **`_includes/`** â€” Reusable Liquid snippets for rendering source lists 
- **`_data/sources.yml`** â€” Master list of source metadata, referenced across incidents  
- **`_data/evidence/`** â€” Holds justifications for how fields were coded as evidence metadata  
- **`sources/`** â€” Holds raw files like PDFs, admin statements, Daily Bruin articles  
- **`projects/`** â€” Markdown pages like public-facing analysis summaries or indexes  
- **`appendix/`** â€” Exported data, figures, and charts (for publication or inspection)  
- **`_layouts/`** â€” Controls how each incident renders on the site

---

## ðŸ“˜ Content Types

- **Incident pages** â†’ Generated from `_incidents/*.md` using `layout: incident`  
- **Incident index** â†’ Rendered via Liquid loop in `projects/incident-analysis.md`  
- **Sources** â†’ Centralized metadata in `_data/sources.yml`, content in `sources/` folder

---

## âœ… To Add a New Incident

1. Create `INC-XXX.md` in `_incidents/`  
2. Fill out YAML front matter with required fields  
3. Add narrative summary as Markdown body  
4. Update `sources.yml` if new sources were used  
5. Drop new source files in `sources/`  
6. Rebuild site â€” incident auto-appears in index

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodological Integrity

This project is designed for:
- Transparency  
- Replicability  
- Neutral source anchoring (e.g., Daily Bruin as sole inclusion source)

All structured variables (severity, visibility, admin response) are rule-based and consistently coded. Media bias and student narratives are treated as contextual controls, not incident selectors.
