## University Messaging
{: .custom-section-header}
The tone for UCLA's handling of campus culture is largely set by Gene Block, who has held the position of university chancellor for the last 17 years. Viewing his opening statement during the House Comittee on Education and 
the Workforce hearing (May 23rd), he sounds resigned to "put up with" any and all speech protected by the constitution, drawing parallels to his own experiences with extremists and antisemitism. 
See [house-hearing](##fig:congressional-hearing) @ 42 minutes for details. 

On Novemeber 10th, Block (who is set to retire on July 31, 2024) released a statement addressing incidents of discrimation on campus. "Today, I joined University of California 
President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors in issuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses — including UCLA — over the 
past several weeks. We must be crystal clear: discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding. Our 
full message appears below."[^163]

"More than denounce bigotry, though, we must also actively work against it. President Drake will be sharing a series of systemwide initiatives in the coming weeks to address the current university climate, and
my administration will be launching its own set of efforts to strengthen community and reaffirm our values in this period of intense strife."[^163]

Yet despite the Chancellor's words, an antisemitic characature still appeared on campus on the March 20th date of the UC Regents meeting (see [Figure](##fig:regents-antisemitic-pig)). The response to the statue (on March 28th) was to say it 
had been removed and to condemn it it as "antisemitic" and "hateful"; calling it an "affront" to UCLA's "Principles of Community" and "True Bruin Values"[^164]. The message also took care to say,  

"It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity." [^164]

University administrators and Gene Block continued with the same tone during and after the protest. On April 26th Mary Osako, Vice Chacellor for Strategic Communications wrote, 
"It's also important to note that we are following University of California systemwide policy guidance, which directs us not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical 
safety of our campus community."[^167]

When escalating aggression between protesting sides became more and more apparent, the Daily Bruin Reported on April 28th, 
"Osako said in the statement. "As an institution of higher education, we stand firmly for the idea that even when we disagree, we must still engage respectfully and recognize one another's humanity. We are dismayed that certain individuals 
instead chose to jeopardize the physical safety of the community.""[^167]

On April 30th a crytpic flyer was released to the encampment saying,
"The established ecampment is unlawful and violates university policy. For non-UCLA affiliates: Please be aware that your presence on campus as a non-affiliate engaged in an encampment violates the law and constitutes criminal behavior subject to 
misdemeanor charges.[^165] 

California Education Code section 92440.5, and the regulations it authorizes, limit the conduct of people who are not students or employees of the University of California on 
university property. Violations of these regulations are punishable as a misdemeanor.[^165] 

Anyone not affiliated with the university who chooses to come to campus should keep these regulations in mind. For example, any sign or flag must be smaller than 30 x 30 inches and on poles shorter than 18 inches (section 100014). No masking 
(section 100013-L) or camping (section 100005) is allowed."[^165] 

On the same day, following the distributed flyer, at 5:05 pm Chancellor Block mentioned student conduct investigations into those who had blocked access to parts of campus and declared the encampment to be unauthorized in a campuswide email, ""UCLA 
supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid," Block said in the statement. "These incidents have put many on our campus, 
especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear.""[^166] 

The events to follow received a great deal of press. For a full Bruin Daily account of the violence that unfolded on the evening of April 30th please see[^169]. In short, when counter-protesters attempted to breach the encampment barrier to assault protesters, 
UCPD and private security CSC failed to act right away, and it was not until hours later that LAPD and CHP showed up to the scene to quell the violence. Statements released during and after the protests can be found here.[^161][^162]



## University Support
{: .custom-section-header}
In the days after the encampment was cleared, Block gave students the standard resources for reporting, "Block also encouraged people to report incidents of violence to UCPD and discrimination to the Civil Rights Office, as well as using campus counseling resources. LAPD officers 
remained in Dickson Plaza as of 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday."[^171]

While the degree of force was excessive, it seems students remained confused about why "protesting peacefully" meant forcible removal, "Students denounced UCLA's decision to have police sweep the Palestine solidarity encampment early 
Thursday morning (5/2), saying the degree of force was excessive on what they saw as peaceful protest."[^172]
 
Block has since been addressing the violence with administrative changes, "Chancellor Gene Block announced Sunday that the university has created a new Office of Campus Safety, which will manage UCPD and the Office of Emergency Management."[^173] 
 
"The change moves the oversight of UCPD and campus safety operations away from the office of Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck to the new office."[^173] 
 
"The Office of Campus Safety will be led by inaugural Associate Vice Chancellor Rick Braziel[^174][^175], who has worked in public safety for more than 30 years, according to the email announcement. He served as the chief of 
police for the Sacramento Police department from 2008 to 2012 and has been an instructor at California State University, Humboldt since 2000."[^173] 


In general, there are targeted and optional resources for faculty, employees, and students with respect to civil rights protections. Civil rights training modules for the UCLA community are located here.[^178] Title IX training is required for 
everyone, annually or biannually. while Title VI and VII are not federally mandated, faculty do receive mandatory Title VII training as well (workplace discrimination).[^179] A workshop is also available (optional, upon request) called "Establishing 
Equity and Inclusion in the University Setting: Strategies, Resources and Best Practices (live workshop provided by EDI)" which would presumably cover Faculty interactions with students, likely involving some Title VI protections and 
code of conduct.[^180]

For students, it is unknown whether Title VI training is mandatory. There is a power point presentation that students receive at orientation here[^181]. Gene Block mentioned at the House committee hearing that currently the training (a 12 slide
power point) has an approximate 90% participation rate, so it is presumed optional. From the looks of it, the power point is reductive, with sparse information with respect to code of conduct but reporting information is present. 

In general, there are informational resources given by the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion that oversees the Civil Rights Office. Among the offices that make up the CRO are the Title IX Office and the Discrimination Prevention Office (DPO).
Education and reporting goes through any of these offices. UCLA's efforts with respect to specific groups can be seen here for Jewish students[^176] and here Palestinian, Muslim, and Arab students[^177].
