Among the main contributors to the "Pro-Palestinian" protest movement are Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP at UCLA), 
the UC Divest Coalition[^44], and Faculty for Justice in Palestine. These groups have led the way in messaging and demands, 
and have received support from students, faculty, the UAW and other student organizations.
##### USAC Cultural Affairs Commission (CAC)

One organization that has joined in strong support of the movement is the UCLA Cultural Affairs Commission (CAC)[^45]. 
The org's messaging on their UCLA hosted webpage is somewhat benign ([Figure 1](##fig:cac-org-website)), stating 
"The mission of the Cultural Affairs Commission (CAC) is to put on quality programming with cultural, political, or 
social relevance that is accessible to all students." One of the first 4 Undergraduate Student Association Council (USAC) 
organizations founded, the CAC has been active at UCLA for more than 50 years. Funding to support USAC organizations comes from 
"student activity fees", a part of tuition paid by every student. This means that serving "all students" is not only a mission, 
but a responsibility. 

In 2018 the serving commissioner expressed what he identified as "the problematic culture that exists at the University, which inadvertently 
oppresses [marginalized] individuals on the basis of race, gender, religion, etc."[^49]. These views indicate a level of distrust in UCLA's ability 
to maintain an inclusive and fair environment on campus. Whether this distrust escalated to creating a potentially toxic environment within the org 
itself, and for how long, is unknown.

On October 9th, 2023 CAC posted the message in [Figure 2](##fig:cac-instagram-post-1) on its Instagram profile. 
It is clear the CAC understands the events of Oct 7th to be part of the Palestinian struggle in "liberation from Israel" as
opposed to a terrorist attack by Hamas. While First Amendment rights protects these views, even if they are "extreme", the 
post calls into question the use of USAC funds to support this messaging. 

The statement ([Figure 3](##fig:cac-instagram-post-2)) goes on to say it's possible to criticize the policies or actions of the Israeli government 
without being antisemitic. However, at the end of the message are the words "From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free". Regardless of whether
this phrase is generally considered threatening rhetoric, it is clear that a USAC funded organization must function on behalf of all students, at least
insofar as the complete omission of threatening language towards any single group. It is clear 
that the Instagram post does not uphold a mission "that is accessible to all students" with respect to either the timing or the political position of this post.

Political imagery on CAC’s Instagram profile takes on a “militant” vibe, with outlandish/unapologetic imagery. [Figure 4](##fig:CAC-block-resign) below depicts 
the UCLA Chancellor (who is Jewish) Gene Block’s face affixed to the body of a pig wearing a police uniform. The imagery combines antisemitic stereotypes 
with derogatory slang for police officers[^46].

Most troubling, however, is what looks to be subliminal imagery referencing a Nazi classification system used in concentration camps([Figure 5](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-1) and 
[Figure 6](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-2))[^50]. A Trump ad was removed by Facebook for using the same imagery—“The social media company said the ads violated its policies against "organized hate."“[^47] The red triangle most directly
references a Nazi concentration camp political prisoner, however, the true meaning for the triangle on display at pro-Palestinian protests is unknown. It 
could be referencing any targeted group for Nazi hate, but is made to be red in reference to the Palestinian flag; hate “in the name of” Palestine so to speak.

[Figure 7](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-3) shows the full name of the USAC organization  tent at the pro-Palestine encampment site (Instagram post dated 4/25). “Cultural Affairs Commissioner Alicia Verdugo, 
who is running for reelection , was in attendance and did not  respond to requests for comment…It is unclear if funds from USAC offices are being used to fund resources at the demonstration, but the 
text “PAID FOR BY USAC” is visible on the Cultural Affairs Commission tent.”[^48] Other USAC candidates and officials have expressed solidarity with either the protests or counter-protests, but 
weren't necessarily in attendance on official student gov't business[^48]. [Figure 8](##fig:cac-tent-propaganda-4) shows the tent's proximity to the sign. [Figure 9](##fig:cac-nakba-day) shows a more recent post 
again displaying the triangle. It seems despite the fact that this imagery has been pointed out and commented on in the Daily Bruin (more on this later), no one is paying attention closely enough. 
 
It is the author's opinion that based on their USAC affiliation, CAC should not have any content on any of their public facing sites that they aren't willing to post on their UCLA hosted site. Their 
content directly contradicts their mission *to be accessible to all students*. To the best of the author's knowledge, no other organization, USAC-affiliate or not, has any content displaying Nazi insignia or hateful imagery. 
Other groups are "tagged" by CAC as can be seen in a few of the above screenshots, which does mean the content is also displayed on their Instagram profiles. 

##### Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)

The (sparse and largely blank) SJP message from the "UCLA-affiliated" lens is political ([Figure 10](##fig:sjp-org-website-UCLA)), but falls short of infringement of Title VI protections[^51]. 


[Figure 11](##fig:sjp-insta-early) shows an SJP Instagram post from 2022. Early messaging suggests key terms within the lexicon of SJP and perhaps the pro-Palestinian movement in general. Terms such as “Zionism” 
and “IOF” are used here. The definition of these terms can vary widely based on context and are used within both the pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel conversation. Teach-ins are a regular practice 
among student organizations; empowering them to define these words within their pedagogy. SJP’s early messaging suggests frustration with UC involvement with “IOF” interest groups. They also state “The UCs are limiting 
the knowledge on Arab and Muslim communities by omitting an Arab studies department or classes focusing on Palestinian perspective, thus endorsing Zionist ideology through erasing by opposing narratives.”

[Figure 12](##fig:sjp-insta-teach-in) SJP began pro-Palestinian messaging early after the attacks of Oct 7th as well. As a non-USAC, “political” student organization, they are within their rights to hold formal discussions, 
but with no alternative messaging they are able to control the conversation. 

[Figures 13](##fig:sjp-insta-letter-regents-1) and [14](##fig:sjp-insta-letter-regents-2) show SJP’s grievances with the UC Regents regarding rhetoric surrounding the Gaza conflict. There’s no language showing support of Hamas, but 
SJP stays focused on the “plight of the Palestinian people” in this post despite its timing with respect to Oct 7th. Here they write what will eventually become the protest demands for the pro-Palestinian movement at UCLA.

[15](##fig:sjp-reddit) shows a reddit post from approximately October alleging that SJP referred to the events of Oct 7th as the "Al-Aqsa" flood. Whether this post is in fact an SJP post is unverified by the author because there is no 
such post on the SJP Instagram profile page. It could be that it has since been deleted. If this is in fact an SJP post, it is clear that their views with respect to Hamas and Oct 7th are not "moderate".
