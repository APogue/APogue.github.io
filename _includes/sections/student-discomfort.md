A reoccurring theme here is that students are curious and interested to learn and share their knowledge. One would assume that the same goes for any forum where they are able to interact without fear of repercussion. 
It isn’t enough to say, “don’t be antisemitic” or “don’t use this word or that word”. They want to share their personal identities and views, and they want to learn. Without guidance and insight, they are directing these 
conversations on their own. If you tell them “don’t do it”, they will find an open forum, and do it anyways. The Reddit community gives insight into the student’s opinions, gaps in understanding, curiosity, the support they 
need, and the concerns they have. The post dates vary, but approximately coincide with protest dates (April 25th - May 6th).
