“The U.S. Department of Education’s [Office for Civil Rights][^26] enforces, among other statutes, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education 
programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX states: No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”

“Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX…" [^27]

Compliance monitoring and training enforcement for Title IX is carried out by the U.S. Department of Education, specifically the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the 
Title IX Office are responsible for reporting Title IX data and compliance with training mandates.

“UCLA Title IX is committed to transparency and accountability. The office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion produces an annual [Public Accountability Report][^28] where Title IX data is included. We encourage 
you to review the report in its entirety though Title IX data is extracted for your convenience.” [^29]

“The Title IX Office ensures compliance with Title IX Federal law. A component of the law requires Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment training for all community members. Our office offers training to the UCLA 
community on conduct prohibited by Title IX and the UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment policy.” [^30] 

Practically, Title IX training explains a student's rights and who they can report any incidents of sexual harassment or misconduct to. The most helpful part of the training addresses *when* a scenario arises 
that is not normal or healthy—it’s difficult to prove to ourselves and others when we are being gaslighted, so we may not trust our own judgement. It also helps us be *prepared* when faced with these scenarios, 
so we are ready to either help ourselves or others. Often times it takes a couple practice tries before the proper protective measures become reflexive. The videos present 
students with hypotheticals, demonstrating how social situations might become toxic. It then instructs students on the best course of action given the scenario. In essence, it teaches us to parse the fundamentals 
of each situation that might otherwise be relegated to our subconscious. “Here is coercive behavior, here is threatening behavior, here is someone trying to sabotage you, here we might be more considerate, 
here is a chance to support and show understanding”. Young minds need guidance rather than the emotional burden of trial and error. The videos don’t just help potential victims, it also helps potential 
perpetrators of Title IX misconduct in giving some perspective and educating individuals on what misconduct is, how others view it, and the repercussions that follow. For everyone, our judgement goes from 
hazy and nebulous, where we might only realize hours or weeks later that a situation was unhealthy, to an immediate behavior classifier that can read a situation and choose a reaction from the preconceived 
guidance set that was provided.

While there is a good case for Title IX training here, there are still insufficient sources with adequate sample statistics relating to the impact of Title IX training, and some remain critical of a continuing lack of preventative instructional measures and resources for students [^31].
