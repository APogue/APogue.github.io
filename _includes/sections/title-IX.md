Just notes:
Title IX training explains your rights and who you can report any incidents of sexual harassment or misconduct to. The most helpful part of the training addresses *when* a scenario arises 
that is not normal or healthy—it’s difficult to prove to ourselves and others when we are being gaslighted, so we may not trust our own judgement. It also helps us be *prepared* when faced with these scenarios, 
so we are ready to either help ourselves or others. Often times it takes a couple practice tries before the proper protective measures become reflexive. The videos present 
students with hypotheticals, demonstrating how social situations might become toxic. It then instructs students on the best course of action given the scenario. In essence, it teaches us to parse the fundamentals 
of each situation that might otherwise be relegated to our subconscious. “Here is coercive behavior, here is threatening behavior, here is someone trying to sabotage you, here we might be more considerate, 
here is a chance to support and show understanding”. Young minds need guidance rather than the emotional burden of trial and error. The videos don’t just help potential victims, it also helps potential 
perpetrators of Title IX misconduct in giving some perspective and educating individuals on what misconduct is, how others view it, and the repercussions that follow. For everyone, our judgement goes from 
hazy and nebulous, where we might only realize hours or weeks later that a situation was unhealthy, to an immediate behavior classifier that can read a situation and choose a reaction from the preconceived 
guidance set that was provided.
