The above image ([Figure 2](#fig:protest-invite)) has 17,645 “likes” (bottom right-of-center), showing the combined “marketing” power of the organizations. A UCLA media-relations office with large reach would help to 
control and mediate this conversation. Groups with “extreme” rhetoric underlying what could otherwise be a “worthy cause” to students leaves them no choice but to follow their media pages. 
This page could also pick among student voices that may represent a large portion of the student body but lack media reach, such as Hillel and Chabad.
