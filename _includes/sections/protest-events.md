On April 25th, the Daily Bruin reported "An encampment led by students in support of Palestine began Thursday morning outside of Royce Hall. The encampment was organized by Students for Justice in Palestine, and garnered the attention of 
around 100 students by 10 a.m."[^70] SJP lead the way, with a list of demands shown in [1](##fig:protest-demands) and together with other orgs called on students to join with them ([2](##fig:protest-invite)). The post in 
[Figure 2](##fig:protest-invite) has 17,645 “likes” (bottom right-of-center), showing the combined “marketing” power of the organizations. 

Right off the bat, unknown perpetrators began putting troubling imagery on display. [Figure 3](##fig:large-sign-red-triangle) and [Figure 4](##fig:same-large-sign-red-triangle) shows the same large sign 
that would become emblematic of the movement in its first days and would appear as a symbol representative of the encampment in the Daily Bruin[^277] several non-affiliate articles.[^72][^274][^275][^276]

[Figure 7](##fig:smaller-red-triangle) shows Royce Hall adorned once again with the Nazi imagery, this time on a smaller sign. [Figure 8](##fig:occupation-death-sign-people) and [Figure 9](##fig:tent-endorsement-2) show the same sign 
(([Figure 5](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-1) and [Figure 6](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-2)) that has been displayed on CAC's Instagram page. Here you see, in context, the large number of people whose attention SJP, UC Divest, and CAC have
garnered. The combined organizational power (and the national movement) has put orgs that had small followings at earlier rallies center stage, and from these photos it looks as though they've retained hateful imagery in their messaging 
nonetheless.  

"Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by the encampment, adding that he believes some 
of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. "I feel very uncomfortable," he said. 
"I might skip my classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on campus."[^73]

It was mentioned previously that CAC is a USAC funded student organization, and its commissioner, Alicia Verdugo is an elected student government official. [Figure 9](##fig:tent-endorsement-2) is a photo taken by a Daily Bruin reporter showing the 
a CAC tent was present in the encampment. "In addition to the candidates and officers at the encampment, tents with the logos of Verdugo’s office and the Campus Events Commission (CEC) were present...It is unclear if funds from USAC 
offices are being used to fund resources at the demonstration, but the text "PAID FOR BY USAC" is visible on the Cultural Affairs Commission tent."

"Eli Tsives, a candidate for general representative, was part of the counter-protest against the encampment. Tsives, who alleged the encampment was promoting hate speech, criticized Verdugo's use of her platform to promote messages he 
believes makes Jewish students uncomfortable on campus."

""They (the Cultural Affairs Commission) have purposefully used their position and power to make us Jewish students feel unsafe," he [Eli Tsives] said." That sentiment was echoed by a Hillel post, [Figure 10](##fig:hillel-insta-safe-pass), offering 
an alternative safe space for students who may not want to interact with protesters. 

"Tsives' perspective was not shared by some of the other candidates. Nuñez-Verdugo said they support the use of USAC money – which comes from student fees – to fund resources for 
the encampment, adding that students should be provided a space to engage in activism on campus." [^74]

[fig cec](##fig:cec-tent) shows the CEC tent in the top left corner of the photo (yellow tent). Analyzing the metadata of the photo ([fig cec metadata](##fig:cec-tent-metadata)), it looks like the photo was taken at 6:16 pm on 5/26. The metadata for
[Figure 9](##fig:tent-endorsement-2), with the sign still showing the red triangle, can be seen in [cac metadata](##fig:cac-tent-metadata), it looks like this photo was taken at 12:23 pm on 5/26. The Instagram photos CAC has on their Instagram
profile (see group related to [cac insta tent](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-1)) is dated April 25th. Which means that the CAC tent had been set up since the start of the protest, while there is no evidence that is the case for CEC. 
The metadata for the signage in [unknown-big](##fig:uknown-red-triangle) is shown in [unknown-big](##fig:unknown-red-triangle-metadata) and for [unknown small](##fig:smaller-red-triangle) is [unknown small](##fig:smaller-red-triangle-metadata).
All of these photos were taken on April 25th, meaning it is likely these signs were removed after the 1st day of protests, by whom is unknown. 

Without the hate symbology, the remaining relevant *imagery*, such as  [fig with Jewish present](##fig:anti-zionism-not), depicted a typical protest environment with a mix of people in support of Israel and rallying for the pro-Palestinian cause.

On Sunday, April 28th the largest number of protesters turned out from UCLA and the greater LA area to demonstrate in support of Israel, [figure](##fig:pro-israel-sunday), and the pro-Palestinian cause. California State Assemblymember 
Rick Chavez Zbur, also came to speak at the event in support of Israel.

"Demonstrators from the Palestinian Youth Movement and the Palestinian Feminist Collective led a march from the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center to Royce Hall in support of the encampment."[^279] [Figure](##fig:let-gaza-live) shows 
participants in the march holding umbrellas with watermelons on them. For context, the watermelon is composed of the same colors as the Palestinian flag, "Following the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, public displays of the Palestinian flag were 
outlawed in Israel. Anyone who displayed the flag or its colors could face arrest. The ban was lifted in the 1993 Oslo Accords, but Israel's new far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir ordered the removal of Palestinian flags 
flying in public spaces last year."[^280]

Standing Together LA, shown in [figure](##fig:standing-together-la), aims to promote peace and dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli communities, demonstrating that despite conflicts, people from both 
backgrounds can support justice, freedom, and equality for all. They focus on showing that coexistence and mutual understanding are possible,

"Dozens of people from Standing Together LA also demonstrated outside Dickson Plaza. Mikey Aboutboul, a third-year ethnomusicology student who was with Standing Together LA, said his group’s 
demonstration was aimed at showing that not everyone is polarized, and there is some middle ground between different groups."[^279]

On the evening of April 30th (see the abbreviated timeline in *Supplimentary Information* for details), microagressions and isolated incidents of threats and assault that had been going on for days turned into all out violence.

"After the barricades came down, counter-protesters and protesters inside the encampment began to fight. Counter-protesters shot fireworks into the encampment just after 11 p.m., and irritant gasses were released from both sides. 
A Daily Bruin reporter was indirectly sprayed in the face."[^278] A photo taken by a Bruin reporter depicting the scene is shown in [figure](##fig:ucla-fireworks). 

Lois Beckett descibes danger befalling a Bruin journalist in [figure](##tweet-bruin-beaten) (as written by Colleen Shelby from the LA Times) , "As she tried to break free, one UCLA student journalist said, she was punched repeatedly 
in the chest and upper abdomen; another student journalist was pushed to the ground and beaten and kicked for nearly a minute." Terrible, uninterrupted violence occured that night for least two hours.[^283] [figure](##tweet-no-police) 
shows a scene 30 minutes after police arrived, and had not yet intervened.[^283] [figure](##tweet-who-perp) shows more violence with reporter Kyung Lah detailing CNN's investigation to identify suspects committing assault.[^285] Another 
investigative report identifying suspects can be found here.^[^282]

On Wednesday May 1st, JVP stated in their IG post ([Figure 35](##fig:jvp-encampment-dismantled)) that they'd "received word" that a police sweep of the encampment would begin at 6 pm that evening. The post goes on to say "Students need you now!
They are asking for the community to show up. Join them and us..." [figure](##fig:faculty-and-staff) shows student and faculty responding to the call, and turning out in support.

"The encampment received another dispersal notice from authorities at 12:30 a.m. Thursday that could be heard from across Dickson Plaza, urging protesters to exit between Royce Hall and Kaplan Hall. A medic in the 
encampment said LAPD told medical staff and doctors in the area, who would be treating basic injuries such as pepper spraying, to be prepared by 1 a.m. "You risk serious injury," an officer said through the 
megaphone during the dispersal announcement."[^287]

"By 1:20 a.m. Thursday, police officers began sweeping the encampment, with their first detainment of a protester occurring at 1:55 a.m."[^287]

Sergio Olmos tweeted a Cal Matters investigation ([figure](##tweet-cal-matters)) showing apparent unnecessary use of force on UCLA students that had recently been made illegal by injuries sustained during the George Floyd protests. 

"As the sun rose, hundreds of officers of municipal and state law enforcement agencies continued their sweep of the UC Divest Coalition and Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA encampment, capping off weeklong protests that have 
resulted in altered class schedules, hundreds of arrests and injuries."[^288]

"Chancellor Gene Block released a statement Thursday afternoon claiming that the Palestine solidarity encampment had been shut down because it led to unsafe university conditions and interfered with UCLA's educational mission."[^289] 

"Block confirmed that more than 200 people were arrested, with more than 300 leaving voluntarily Thursday morning following a police sweep of the encampment."[^289]

Hillel and Chabad House commented on the events in their Instagram posts in [Figure 35](##fig:hillel-comment-protest) and [Figure 37](##fig:graffiti-royce), respectively, calling the events "devastating" and stating 
"there will be a lot to reflect on in the coming days and weeks ahead about the anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish hate and rhetoric that was part of and in parts of the encampment."
