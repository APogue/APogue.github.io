On April 25th, the Daily Bruin reported "An encampment led by students in support of Palestine began Thursday morning outside of Royce Hall. The encampment was organized by Students for Justice in Palestine, and garnered the attention of 
around 100 students by 10 a.m."[^70] SJP lead the way, with a list of demands shown in [1](##fig:protest-demands) and together with other orgs called on students to join with them ([2](##fig:protest-invite)). The post in 
[Figure 2](##fig:protest-invite) has 17,645 “likes” (bottom right-of-center), showing the combined “marketing” power of the organizations. 

Right off the bat, unknown perpetrators began putting troubling imagery on display. [Figure 3](##fig:large-sign-red-triangle) and [Figure 4](##fig:same-large-sign-red-triangle) shows the same large sign 
that would become emblematic of the movement in its first days and would appear as a symbol representative of the encampment in the Daily Bruin[^277] several non-affiliate articles.[^72][^274][^275][^276]

[Figure 7](##fig:smaller-red-triangle) shows Royce Hall adorned once again with the Nazi imagery, this time on a smaller sign. [Figure 8](##fig:occupation-death-sign-people) and   [Figure 9](##fig:tent-endorsement-2) show the same sign 
(([Figure 5](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-1) and [Figure 6](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-2)) that has been displayed on CAC's Instagram page. Here you see, in context, the large number of people whose attention SJP, UC Divest, and CAC have
garnered. The combined organizational power (and the national movement) has put orgs that had small followings at earlier rallies center stage, and from these photos it looks as though they have retained hateful imagery in their messaging 
nonetheless.  

"Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by the encampment, adding that he believes some 
of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. "I feel very uncomfortable," he said. 
"I might skip my classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on campus."[^73]

It was mentioned previously that CAC is a USAC funded student organization, and its commissioner, Alicia Verdugo is an elected student government official. [Figure 9](##fig:tent-endorsement-2) is a photo taken by a Daily Bruin reporter showing the 
a CAC tent was present in the encampment. "In addition to the candidates and officers at the encampment, tents with the logos of Verdugo’s office and the Campus Events Commission (CEC) were present...It is unclear if funds from USAC 
offices are being used to fund resources at the demonstration, but the text "PAID FOR BY USAC" is visible on the Cultural Affairs Commission tent."

"Eli Tsives, a candidate for general representative, was part of the counter-protest against the encampment. Tsives, who alleged the encampment was promoting hate speech, criticized Verdugo's use of her platform to promote messages he 
believes makes Jewish students uncomfortable on campus." 

""They (the Cultural Affairs Commission) have purposefully used their position and power to make us Jewish students feel unsafe," he [Eli Tsives] said." That sentiment was echoed by a Hillel post, [Figure 10](##fig:hillel-insta-safe-pass), offering 
an alternative safe space for students who may not want to interact with protesters. 

"Tsives' perspective was not shared by some of the other candidates. Nuñez-Verdugo said they support the use of USAC money – which comes from student fees – to fund resources for 
the encampment, adding that students should be provided a space to engage in activism on campus." [^74]

[fig cec](##fig:cec-tent) shows the CEC tent in the top left corner of the photo (yellow tent). Analyzing the metadata of the photo ([fig cec metadata](##fig:cec-tent-metadata)), it looks like the photo was taken at 6:16 pm on 5/26. The metadata for
[Figure 9](##fig:tent-endorsement-2), with the sign still showing the red triangle, can be seen in [cac metadata](##fig:cac-tent-metadata), it looks like this photo was taken at 12:23 pm on 5/26. The Instagram photos CAC has on their Instagram
profile (see group related to [cac insta tent](##fig:cac-tent-propoganda-1)) is dated April 25th. Which means that the CAC tent had been set up since the start of the protest, while there is no evidence that is the case for CEC. 
The metadata for the signage in [unknown-big](##fig:uknown-red-triangle) is shown in [unknown-big](##fig:unknown-red-triangle-metadata) and for [unknown small](##fig:smaller-red-triangle) is [unknown small](##fig:smaller-red-triangle-metadata).
All of these photos were taken on April 25th, meaning it is likely these signs were removed after the 1st day of protests, by whom is unknown. 

Without the hate symbology, the remaining relevant *imagery*, such as  [fig with Jewish present](##fig:anti-zionism-not), depicted a typical protest environment with a mix of people fighting for the pro-Palestinian cause.

As days at the enampment passed (see the abbreviated timeline in *Supplimentary Information* for details) the mounting aggression from counter-protesters, in the form of harrassment and physical altercation, began as early as April 25.
