David Myers wrote an op-ed entitled *Antisemitic imagery at UC Regents meeting protest threatens campus discourse* where he addressed the tense political climate at UCLA, "Since Oct. 7, our campus – like so many across the country – 
has been the site of intense and often tense discourse and action. The divide between those who support the cause of Palestinian liberation and 
those who support Israel’s right to exist has deepened more than at any point in my 32 years at UCLA, creating a seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the two sides.

It has also created, at various points in time, a sense of unsafety among many members of the university community, especially students. This too tracks larger national trends, according to a 2024 report that shows that 56% of Jewish 
university students polled after Oct. 7 felt in personal danger, and 52% of Muslim students felt in personal danger."[^58]

Myers depiction of this "unbridgeable gulf" has been corroborated by several Daily Bruin articles, where one titled *Students voice worries over Islamophobia on UCLA campus*, dated November 19th, details several concerning statements made by students. 
 
“"I’ve been spit in the face. I’ve been directly pushed. I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,” said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. “I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m 
getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.”"

"A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of physical violence 
perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed."[^60]

Another, *Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus*, highlights pervasive language among the pro-Palestinian movement that some students feel is threatening. 
“"The challenging environment is that the form of antisemitism that we’re often experiencing, especially since Oct. 7, is a form of antisemitism that has become normal,” Gold said.
Gold said he believes rallies in support of Palestine have made Jewish students feel unsafe on campus. He added that he feels that chants such as “Resistance is justified when people are occupied” and “From the river to the sea, 
Palestine will be free” are statements intended to intimidate others."[^61]

A direct account was given on Feb 8th by a Bruin journalist at a BDS rally ([bla](##fig:feb-8-rally)), "The protest, which was hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine alonside the UC Divest Coalition at UCLA, also contained chants and speeches."

“Do you realize how Zionists, … they have that ugly, half-American, half-Zionist smiles?” they said in a speech, leading to shouts of agreement from the crowd.
The speaker also repeated insults at counter-protesters, even after being instructed not to engage with them by other organizers.
“They’re just losers who are colonizers and settlers, and they will be defeated,” they said in a speech. “They are stupid, annoying and ugly.”[^62]

Myers also addressed---and likely the reason he felt compelled to speak out in the first place---an antisemitic statue placed outside of the UC Regents meeting on March 20th. "The regents’ meeting attracted protesters who bore signs and uttered chants 
calling for divestment from companies that have ties to the Israeli military. Alongside these signs, someone placed...a statue that depicted a pig holding a bag of money in one hand and a birdcage with a keffiyeh in the other. To anyone familiar 
with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not to recoil."

While the antisemitic imagery displayed in [21](##fig:regents-antisemitic-pig) might be obvious to some, this is not the case for others. [22](##fig:reddit-regents-pig) shows "MysteriousQueen81" attempting to gamify logic in order to argue the
semantics underlying the imagery. To which anyone familiar with racist imagery in our art[^56] and culture[^57] might borrow "ToTheLastParade"'s response in saying, "The mental gymnastics in this post..." 

[Figure 23](##fig:Hillel-oct-concern-1) and [Figure 24](##fig:hillel-oct-concern-2) depict Hillel's Executive Director, Dan Gold messaging over the pro-Palestinian movement's immediate offensive stance after the events of Oct 7th. The posts, 
dated October 26th, refer to a flooding of "emails and phone calls from constituents and stakeholders from every corner of our community" over the chant against "Israel and Jews..."we charge you with genocide"".

[Figure 25](##fig:hillel-dec-letter) shows a post written by Hillel Student Board Members on December 18th, stating "Despite numerous attempts to engage with our Student Government to acknowledge the pain felt by Jewish students and create formidable paths to combat hate, many of our 
leaders have decided to choose a path of ignorance instead." The post goes on to condemn Campus Administration and council members for their (willful) negligence, and proposes methods of taking incidents of harassment into their own hands.

[Figure 22](##fig:reddit-hamas-islam-death) is a photo of a non-affiliate protesting at UCLA in approximately October. On Reddit, the same "mental gymnastics" debate arose, where many on the thread disregarded any "Islamaphobia" by this protester
because the "Hamas" is also written on the sign. I think "Candid_Training1834" put it best when they said "While it's important to address the actions of any organization, it's also crucial not to generalize or stereotype an entire religion
based on the actions of a few. It's not Islamophobic to criticize specific actions, but it becomes problematic when it's used to paint a negative picture of all Muslims."[^59]


The Instagram post below ([28](##fig:instagram-embed)) is referring to a professor led teach-in ([Figure 12](##fig:sjp-insta-teach-in)) occurring on Oct 11th that was met with harassment from UCLA students. A video of the encounter can be found on the 5th page of the post. 
Regardless of how “understandable” being upset may be given the very recent events, the harassment infringes upon Title VI protections. These students were convening to “gain clarity, information, and perspectives on recent escalations in 
Palestine”. No one has the right to physically block peaceful students from accessing a classroom or yell at them using classic Islamophobic derogatory language.
