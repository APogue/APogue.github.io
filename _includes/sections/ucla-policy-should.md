Gold also noted in his email that the UC Regents President Michael Drake announced during the meeting that the 10 UC campuses will be partnering with the Hillel Campus Initiative, which Gold called 
“a welcome and necessary step to better address campus antisemitism and take meaningful action to ensure our campuses are free of hate and fully accepting and inclusionary for all Jewish students, faculty and community members.”

According to The Los Angeles Times, one of the issues discussed during the UC Regents meeting was a proposal requiring faculty departments to put any polemical commentary statements up to a vote before posting and clarifying 
who exactly they are speaking on behalf of. The proposal would also require that faculty polemical commentary be posted on a webpage clearly marked as an opinion page that’s not speaking on the behalf of the university. 
The proposal has been tabled until May; when it was first introduced by Regent Jay Sures, pro-Palestinian protesters shouted “shame on you!” and accused Sures of attempting to censor their point of view.

Reanactments of students blocking other students. Or students witnessing hate speech or imagery, "if you see something, say something". 

There's no HR...

Here is where you write about block and an "online module"

“Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza. In fact, 
it is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land they inhabit.”

The Palestinian student said they were disappointed that an Oct. 13 statement by the chancellor described the Oct. 7 attack as a “grievous act of malice and hate” against Israelis but Palestinian deaths as “loss of life,” as the tonal shift
 emphasizes the violence against Israelis over Palestinians. They added that they feel the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than 
 Palestinian students.
 
 
A UCLA media-relations office with large reach would help to 
control and mediate this conversation. Groups with “extreme” rhetoric underlying what could otherwise be a “worthy cause” to students leaves them no choice but to follow their media pages. 
This page could also pick among student voices that may represent a large portion of the student body but lack media reach, such as Hillel and Chabad. 

“The protesters inside the encampment are also planning on hosting de-escalation workshops for participants to help 
prepare them for the presence of future counter-protesters, Annie said. In a Thursday morning Instagram post, SJP 
had told encampment participants not to engage with counter-protesters. “We are focused on the safety of our people 
and our students, and so that means engaging in tactics of de-escalation,””42

The statue was placed on campus on March 20th and it took until March 28th for UCLA to release a statement. Their solution to its existence was to say it had been removed and refer to UCLA value doctrine and then to "administration-splain" 
that people "should feel comfortable on campus". As a graduate student with very little involvement with campus culture at UCLA and a 2nd generation American of 1/2 Vietnamese and 1/2 Caucasian racial background, I have little to no 
experience with tropes related to this issue. I have literally zero bias, and I can say that if it were directed at me, and the only solution the university could come up with in response to "proudly" hateful imagery is to let me know a week 
late that they "care" and "I should feel good being here" and "it has been removed" I would not feel better at all. The deed has been done, the damage has been done. 


Regardless of what the demands are, should a student governing body that is funded and elected by all students be taking part in these resolutions? If 
the best course of action is for the voting students to hold those that don't represent them accountable, then I have to ask whether a USAC organization commissioner
that partakes the display of antisemitic imagery on the public facing account of the organization should be permitted to sponsor such resolutions? The imagery on CAC's instagram
website shows a clear bias against Jewish students and the activity of this commissioner should be called into question.

why are microgroups being targeted, that exist along an axis of discrimination against one another, and why is this the microcosm for the greater university environment? The entire university needs training, 

in descalation tactics, peaceful protesting, what their first ammendment rights are, (how to be a good "activist"), and most importantly how not to infringe on the civil rights of their other students. 


This should not be about targeted offices and offloading task force objectives to special interest groups. There is a broader need for this training and support, across all UCLA communities. This issue is a symptom of a much greater problem
at UCLA and likely at universities nationwide. Look at the question that asks about whether you've been barred from a group based on gender, and look at the number of responses. It's time to redefine "academic abuse" that is classically
defined by title IX as an issue between individuals in a romantic relationship. Barring someone from a group based on gender or Title VI, that's academic abuse. Or discrimination from a professor stereotyping someone's heritage and whether 
they're "suited" for research, that's academic abuse. look at the title IX complaints, there are a large number of gender discrimination complaints, and having done the title IX training myself, there is no training on it. there would presumably 
be a larger number of complaints filed if there were. Gender discrimination and gender harassment are almost "more fitting" in the Title VI training as a form of discrimination based on biological or assumed identity that creates a "hostile"
academic environment. And it is extremely confusing for a student to understand and process gender discrimination because Title IX began in the 70's as equal access for women, but is contemporarily mischaracterized as protections relating to 
sexual misconduct. So if people can't categorize it as Tile IX or Title VI, they won't address the problems. and neither the universities nor the office of education care to deepen our understanding because really all of this is put into place 
to address liability concerns. And it seems like neither the university or the office of education care to appropriate 
extra funding towards general Title VI or the aforementioned areas of Title IX because honestly, racism and sexism "aren't really a problem anymore" with violations having
a low likelihood of a lawsuit within the statute of limitations. To put it plainly, the misconduct has to be "very serious", like a physical hate crime or rape to be worthy of the funding for the support and prevention. But 
racism and sexism are still very much an issue because the world is changing incredibly quickly and women and minorities are following the same pattern of delayed access that existed in the 70's but in areas like STEM where issues are still
inadequately addressed. and perhaps it isn't just the extra educational support that women and minorities need, perhaps an "inclusive environment" means "soft skills" and "professionalism". Perhaps there are more paths than those to the 
classroom during a protest that are being blocked.  
 
and yet the office of education just awarded UCLA 8 million dollars in funding for issues irrelevant to the wellbeing of its student body...
 
Everyone needs Title VI training, undergraduates, graduate students, professors, administration, everyone. Because academia is a cesspool of toxic behavior with a complete lack of disciplinary action or oversight. There is no HR in academia and 
I guarantee every student would want one---a guide to *professional*, *appropriate*, behavior would be a huge quality of life boost for everyone at this university.
