## Tone
{: .custom-section-header}

David Myers, a Distinguished Professor at UCLA who holds the Sady and Ludwig Kahn Chair in Jewish History wrote in his op-ed, entitled *Antisemitic imagery at UC Regents meeting protest threatens campus discourse*,
“Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza. In fact, 
it is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land they inhabit.”[^200]

It would be sensible to say, UCLA as an institution should behave like an "individual"; a person with views on matters that permit them to agree and disagree with other views without infringing on anyone's 1st Ammendment rights. 
This individual would be "highly influential" because they are well informed, have abundant resources, and global reach. Take for example, the quote by Dr. Myers. While he, like many influential people, is beholden to stakeholders, 
he found the fortitude and the courage to speak up and take a position in these tumultuous times. Currently, the UCLA "individual" is absent---there have been no positions taken, which is problematic when trying to head off a growing 
problem. In contrast, an individual with convictions can predict the direction of a mounting problem and attempt to course correct using their own personal set of values. But if there's no one around to worry over the direction of UCLA's 
campus climate, if there's no one to say, "I don't like where this is going", then the direction it takes is left in the hands of the young and inexperienced. The outcome is at the cost of the young and inexperienced, because thus far UCLA's weak 
tone and vague policy adherence has caused it to largely function as a "hands-off" governing body students report incidents to and take issue with *after* the damage has been done. The signs that this is how UCLA is functioning are everywhere---

The university took no position on pro-Palestinian messaging during the protests and offered no support to students regarding time, place, and manner restrictions. UCLA (the "individual") needs to be "louder" and more resolute. If UCLA didn't like 
where things were going, it might condemn antisemitic chants. If it didn't like where things were headed, it might say, "blockading students from going to their classes is not protected by the 1st Amendment, and if any student continues this behavior
the encampment will be immediately shut down." This way, when they're told to vacate because the "encampment is unlawful and violates university policy" the students won't be left confused as to why. The Daily Bruin 
also pointed out that same day that "The university has not previously called the encampment unlawful or unauthorized."[^166] Really the flyer gave the feeling that UCLA just wanted the protest to stop because if they couldn't give a reason for 
shutting them down there must not be one. Which could cause students, already in an agitated state, to stay put out of pure defiance; unwilling to be subject to the complex "legalese" administrators must be conjuring as an excuse to get rid of them. 

Keeping them informed would have resulted in two paths to the same outcome, either students would have stopped the unlawful behavior or they would have continued but understood why they were being shut down, and may have been more willing to vacate. 
In either case, it was never stated that the encampment was being shut down out of fear for students' safety, although Block stated safety concerns as his reasoning at the hearing.

To reiterate, the flyer made no mention of cause and the 5:04 email stated,

““UCLA supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid,” Block said in the statement. “These incidents have put many on our campus,
 especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear.””[^166]

Even if at the last minute, if the email had mentioned safety concerns, the administration would be coming out of this looking a lot better. Regardless of whether safety was a factor or not, the administration underestimated the imminent threat when the flyer stated
"law enforcement is on hand to protect and keep safe"
students and demonstrators. But 5 days of weak or absent messaging, then a single flyer and an email at 5:04 pm on the 30th were not enough to head off increasing tensions between protesting sides since day one (see *Timeline* in *Supplementary Information*). 
The result: confused and defiant students fell prey to mounting aggression from non-affiliates while the university carried on: lackadaisical, mute, and unobservant. 

"However one feels about the encampment, this attack on our students, faculty and community members was utterly unacceptable. It has shaken our campus to its core and — adding to other abhorrent incidents that we have witnessed and that have circulated on 
social media over the past several days — further damaged our community's sense of security."[^170] So, Block did not agree with pro-Palestinian rhetoric, fair enough, he's entitled. But "however one feels about the encampment" is exactly the weak, 
too little too late, after the fact individual UCLA has become. It begs the question, UCLA may not agree with its students, but does it care about them, unconditionally? Because communication, rules, and guidance are how to avoid danger befalling them. 
And the lack thereof may seem like the individual cares about American freedoms, when in fact what happened here betrays a darker objective. Without being too dramatic on the matter, this looks like a cut and dry case of administrative negligence to me.  

Tonal negligence as a "perpetrator" of misconduct is everywhere in this problem. "Kohanteb said he feels the university should offer more guidance for students about what constitutes hate speech because he feels some students are ignorant when it comes to 
antisemitic tropes.“ I’m scared sometimes that hate usually comes from ignorance,” he said. “If we can inform students of what is and what isn’t antisemitic, and where that line is, I think it’d be very beneficial to all.”[^201] In *Student Reactions* we observe 
pervasive and frequent use of the words or phrase, "Intifada", "Zionist", and "from the river to the sea..." First off, looking at [figure](##fig:doe-ocr-pamphlet) the DOE's OCR office has what looks to be somewhat "dated" circumstances that raise Title VI 
concerns---"A Jewish middle school student feels unsafe at school because classmates routinely place notes with swastikas on the student's backpack, perform Nazi salutes, and make jokes about the Holocaust." It is unlikely that a situation like this would arise anymore, because 
students have found rhetorical "workarounds", so to speak. This situation also seems quite extreme, if this were the bar to clear I'm not sure the House Committee would need to call a hearing. The OCR should update antisemitic vocabulary and devices for pervasive 
harassment (this is the age of social media, not written notes). It should also make clear what the *minimum* requirement is for Title VI infringements. 

Under the circumstances where the applicability of Title VI is unclear, the university should take a position on these and other words within the polemical lexicon. Perhaps an online "activist index" could be maintained, whereby language is defined from an American 
viewpoint (Americans that believe in statehood for Palestine might be referred to as *progressive Zionists* for example). A dedicated UCLA media relations office that's active on campus could be involved in mediating conversations, promoting its position, and 
spotlighting certain organizations who are positive in the community. It would also serve as a guiding tool with respect to demonstrations or other socially or politically relevant events. "nameOfTheWind1" put it best when they said "It's just unfortunate 
to me that the org that does the most organizing has these views and on college campuses at least, is mostly the only game in town for pro-Palestinian advocacy" ([fig](##fig:neutral-take-1)). UCLA can be the other "game in town", or it could pass the mic to 
up and coming positive influencers, giving them the platform they might need to reach students. UCLA could grow its social media presence using events like workshops, round table discussions, teach-ins, a speaker series or by featuring activist artists. The point
I'm trying to make is, the pervasiveness of the problematic behavior comes from the absence of UCLA's "voice" which is creating a vacuum and the void is being filled with the chaos and confusion of its students. 



## Accountability
{: .custom-section-header}
Holding organizations, administrators, students, and non-affiliates accountable can prevent any incidents in the future. 
"Some Jewish organizations on campus, such as Hillel at UCLA, have published statements condemning the harassment of students with opposing views on the war. Kian Kohanteb, a third-year political science student who is a member of the 
leadership of several Jewish organizations on campus, said multiple organizations have published guidelines ahead of rallies supporting Israel that advise all protestors to avoid Islamophobia."[^202]

“The protesters inside the encampment are also planning on hosting de-escalation workshops for participants to help prepare them for the presence of future counter-protesters, Annie said. In a Thursday morning Instagram post, SJP 
had told encampment participants not to engage with counter-protesters. “We are focused on the safety of our people and our students, and so that means engaging in tactics of de-escalation,””[^42]

Above are a couple examples of organizations taking it upon themselves to be the realtime protest guide to students. Organizations are not "obligated" to uphold best practices, they don't have large media reach, and they may harbor extreme views. 
It is careless to rely soley on them.

The student speaking in this live stream ([fig](##tweet-fig)) been quoted by the Daily Bruin before, in [bla](##fig:feb-8-rally) when leading a small rally she was promoting hatespeech (see *Months Prior to Protest Events*). Condemning 
her language publically would raise more awareness about UC Divest and SJP's extreme rhetoric.

Hillel's student president Bella Brannon stated in a Daily Bruin article dated November 19th that, “while she appreciates that the administration has made statements in support of Jewish students, she feels there is more that it could do. 
She added that she has heard of instances of Jewish students not receiving responses to complaints they sent to the UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.”[^201]

Also mentioned in *Months Prior...* was a Hillel post dated Dec 18th claiming  ([bla](##fig:hillel-dec-letter)) "We are seeing hate arise as a tragic ripple effect of the ongoing 
war between Isreal and Hamas, with Campus Administration failing to recognize and confront various reports of harassment submitted
to the office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Additionally numerous council members within our student gov't have
publicized vitriolic remarks that continually harm Jewish students on our campus and exclude Jewish students from 
their inclusion efforts. Despite Hillel's calls to cordially engage with these Student Gov't members, 
our invitations have been repeatedly ignored."[^209]

One would think that the statement in the Daily Bruin would be enough to cause the administration to act on their behalf to hold the EDI office and USAC offending members accountable. 

The same is true of the non-affiliates. There were incidents happening as early as November,

"However, there have been allegations of Islamophobia during and after a rally held Nov. 7 in support of Israel. In a post on Instagram, the Undergraduate Students Association Council’s Cultural Affairs Commission 
claimed that Zionist protesters harassed, threatened and assaulted students who were showing support for Palestine on the same day as the rally."

And accounts of one-sided instigation by Dr. Myers that were surely not protected by the 1st ammendment, 
"Over the course of our hours on the front lines, I estimate that more than 90% of the verbal and physical instigation came from the agitated counterdemonstrators, a fair number of whom spoke Hebrew and appeared to 
come from outside campus. The anti-war group had yellow-vested personnel who maintained discipline and sought to deescalate when the threat of violence arose."[^202]

"But even they were greeted with insulting words from the other side, as were members of a small contingent of a local chapter of Standing Together who came 
bearing signs calling for peace and equality for Palestinians and Jews."[^210]

Certain members of instigating groups should be banned from campus for using hatespeech or inciting violence. Otherwise any rally or demonstration should have security on hand to immediately expel offenders from campus. 


## Education 
{: .custom-section-header}

It ocurred to me that a lot of people have never seen the Nazi classification triangle, well, here it is - [figure](##fig:trump-red-triangle). Know it, report it, simple as that. 

Otherwise what we've learned from this last year: "From the River to the Sea", "Intifada", "Zionist" are part of *extreme*, polemic rhetoric. Until the DOE or other intersted groups can come to a consensus on 
how to address the use of these words, don't chant them, don't write them, don't use them without being prepared to align with anti-American interests.  

The DOE has addressed other hatespeech in [figure](##fig:doe-ocr-pamphlet),
"Muslim students describe, for example, being told by peers in class that "you started 911" and being called "terrorist"". We know students at UCLA are a victim of this language, 

“Even if it’s nothing political and you just have Arabic writing on your shirt – and it could literally mean sunshine – they will literally call you a terrorist now,”[^202].
This isn't highschool but it seems like students need things spelled out explicitly, this word is hatespeech, there are consequenced to its use, period. 

We've also learned that certain "civil disobedience" is not protected, and causes a lot of backlash. There are students who can't get to class, to their jobs, who are disabled and prevented access. They *hate* it when protesters 
block their pathways; they talk to eachother and they spread the word. Scenes like this could be reanacted in a Title VI training video to illustrate. Ultimately the backlash is significant enough to measurably undermine 
a cause, and more importantly it gives administrators the right to shut a protest down. 

Other important topics: if a student witnesses incidents of Title VI or potential Title VI violations, it should be reported, how to be a "message activist" rather than an "identity activist", how as an organization to have a "clear" 
message and stay on message, descalation tactics, 1st Ammendment rights[^213][^214][^215], fostering an inclusive environment, basic professionalism, and the list goes on. 

The Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion has good foundational resources to "learn" here[^211] and to "know" here[^212].

## UCLA Needs to Do More
{: .custom-section-header}

UCLA received 145,904 applications in 2023, they're the most popular university in the country, by application, by a large margin.[^208] UCLA should set an example, not just UC systemwide but nationwide. What more can UCLA do to improve the welfare of its students? The academic year in its entirety, let alone the recent 
protest events make a case for putting more resources towards education, support, and accountability measures. In the section, *University Support* we see that currently, freshman are optionally trained during orientation on Title VI via a 12 slide presentation. When the House committee asked Gene Block what more he could do 
to address antisemitism on campus (see [figure](##fig:congressional-hearing) @ 1:51) he stated that UCLA has developed an online training module on anti-discrimination and they've "bolstered the part on antisemitism". When asked if all students are "required to take antisemitism training", he responded "the anti-discrimination
module is recommended for all incoming students" and that antisemitism is "talked about at orientation". When asked again, what changes are planned beginning with this summer, @ 2:02 Block mentions his plans for orientation this the summer where they will spend "extra time" discussing issues regarding "respectful protest, time, 
place and manner and we will make sure that our students are prepared for what the rules are with regard to appropriate protests". That was the full extent to which Block was questioned by the committee regarding what exists and what is planned with regard to Title VI.

It it not enough. None of what was prepared for the House Committee was enough. We must go beyond the events of this year to gauge what has to be done. The best gauge is by feedback, what kind of feedback is in place to determine whether the students are adequately trained on Title VI? The University of Caliornia system uses 
the University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES) to solicit "students opinions on a broad range of undergraduate students' academic and co-curricular experiences, including instruction, advising and student services." In plain English, its a "long" survey covering a broad range of areas in student life that is 
optional ([fig](##fig:ucues-voluntary)) and administered every two years. A full explanation can be seen in [figure](##fig:ucues-survey-about) and related demographics are shown in [figure](##fig:ucues-infographic). Now, I'm not a statistics major, but I assume the survey must meet some criteria with respect to this subset of 
data adequately representing all undergraduates. If this were true though it would be perfectly "random", and already "opting in" on a survey depends on personal circumstances. Also we see in [figure](##fig:ucues-infographic), the data skews towards Juniors and Seniors, and where are the gender demographics? Based on their 
not being there I would assume they're reflective of UCLA's gender composition but who knows. 

Looking at [figure](##fig:ucues-climate-2022-ucla) and [figure](##fig:ucues-climate-2022-systemwide), UCLA data is approximately reflective of the UC system as a whole. This data was processed and presented on the UC Systemwide UCUES site. There's an interesting drop in response "Total" which is highlighted by the blue box. These
questions are most likely "optional". Now looking at the UCUES data from 2022-2016 ([figure](##fig:ucues-ucla-site-1) and [figure](##fig:ucues-ucla-site-2)) taken directly from UCLA, there might be some insight as to why. "LOD_Percent_Total" are the total number of responses from "somewhat agree", "agree", and "strongly agree", and 
"star" is the percent of total responses composed of this total. We see that in three of the last four surveys, the question "Channels for expressing discrimination or harassment complaints are readily available to students at UCLA" the results are mediocre and the "star" column indicates the question was mandatory. The purple 
data shows that in 2022 they made the question "optional" and got a 6% approval boost from the survey before. We also see that, since 2016 the question "At UCLA, I have been excluded..." has not improved, and was also mandatory. It looks like in 2022 UCUES removed the question all together.

The issue I take with this survey is the same issue I take with trying to train students at orientation. Long, arduous processes make us tired, and we zone out and don't care. Freshman are more worried about surviving their first days at university I'm sure they are not thinking about civil rights, and with all that gets piled 
on them during orientation there's no room left to learn about it anyways. The students should be trained *annually*, like Title IX, and it should be *mandatory*.  When it comes to these surveys, when they are long and many questions are mandatory, you skip all the optional questions just to get through it. *But as we see in the* 
*distinction from 2016, 2018, and 2020, to 2022 mandatory questions give greater insight*. We can then assume that *mandatory surveys* would give greater insight still. The UC System should have a *mandatory*, *annual*, *dedicated* civil rights survey covering Title VI and some aspects of Title IX. I have an 
example here[^205]. The survey needs to be separated from the other surveys on campus life so that students are not tired and "over it"; so that they're in the right mindset.
