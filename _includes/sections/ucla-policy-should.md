Also the office of education needs to update their hatespeech vocab, it's not just swastikas anymore

Gold also noted in his email that the UC Regents President Michael Drake announced during the meeting that the 10 UC campuses will be partnering with the Hillel Campus Initiative, which Gold called 
“a welcome and necessary step to better address campus antisemitism and take meaningful action to ensure our campuses are free of hate and fully accepting and inclusionary for all Jewish students, faculty and community members.”

According to The Los Angeles Times, one of the issues discussed during the UC Regents meeting was a proposal requiring faculty departments to put any polemical commentary statements up to a vote before posting and clarifying 
who exactly they are speaking on behalf of. The proposal would also require that faculty polemical commentary be posted on a webpage clearly marked as an opinion page that’s not speaking on the behalf of the university. 
The proposal has been tabled until May; when it was first introduced by Regent Jay Sures, pro-Palestinian protesters shouted “shame on you!” and accused Sures of attempting to censor their point of view.

Reanactments of students blocking other students. Or students witnessing hate speech or imagery, "if you see something, say something". 

There's no HR...

Here is where you write about block and an "online module"

“Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza. In fact, 
it is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land they inhabit.”

come to a consensus on Zionism 

A UCLA media-relations office with large reach would help to 
control and mediate this conversation. Groups with “extreme” rhetoric underlying what could otherwise be a “worthy cause” to students leaves them no choice but to follow their media pages. 
This page could also pick among student voices that may represent a large portion of the student body but lack media reach, such as Hillel and Chabad. 

“The protesters inside the encampment are also planning on hosting de-escalation workshops for participants to help 
prepare them for the presence of future counter-protesters, Annie said. In a Thursday morning Instagram post, SJP 
had told encampment participants not to engage with counter-protesters. “We are focused on the safety of our people 
and our students, and so that means engaging in tactics of de-escalation,””42

The statue was placed on campus on March 20th and it took until March 28th for UCLA to release a statement. Their solution to its existence was to say it had been removed and refer to UCLA value doctrine and then to "administration-splain" 
that people "should feel comfortable on campus". I have little to no experience with tropes related to this issue. I have zero bias, and I can say that if it were directed at me, and the only solution the university could come up with in 
response to "proudly" hateful imagery is to let me know a week late that "it has been removed" and they "care" and "I should feel good being here" I would not feel better at all. The deed has been done, the damage has been done. 

The flyer had good intentions in saying, that "law enforcement is on hand to protect and keep safe" students and demonstrators. However as the Daily Bruin states, "The university has not previously called the encampment unlawful or 
unauthorized."[^166] Really, the messaging was too passive, cryptic, and the email came too late to effectively communicate cases of misconduct and the urgency of the matter. It is likely that the UCLA administration did not themselves realize 
the urgency, despite mounting tension between protesting sides since day one (see *Timeline* in *Supplementary Information*). Regardless, the efforts to clear the encampment administratively was weak, unclear, and likely left protesters confused. 
As for counterprotesters, listing off a bunch of codes was unlikely to help them understand the consequences of their actions either. Although judging from their behavior it likely wouldn't have mattered either way. 

this would go with the descalation quote
•	Some Jewish organizations on campus, such as Hillel at UCLA, have published statements condemning the harassment of students with opposing views on the war. Kian Kohanteb, a third-year political science student who is a member of the leadership of several Jewish organizations on campus, said multiple organizations have published guidelines ahead of rallies supporting Israel that advise all protestors to avoid Islamophobia.----where is the university on this?


This goes with the slow reaction to protecting protests opinion 
However, there have been allegations of Islamophobia during and after a rally held Nov. 7 in support of Israel. In a post on Instagram, the Undergraduate Students Association Council’s Cultural Affairs Commission claimed that Zionist protesters harassed, threatened and assaulted students who were showing support for Palestine on the same day as the rally.


This goes with the hillel post about no one answering
•	“Brannon said while she appreciates that the administration has made statements in support of Jewish students, she feels there is more that it could do. She added that she has heard of instances of Jewish students not receiving responses to complaints 
they sent to the UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.”

why are microgroups being targeted, that exist along an axis of discrimination against one another, and why is this the microcosm for the greater university environment? The entire university needs training, 

in descalation tactics, peaceful protesting, what their first ammendment rights are, (how to be a good "activist"), and most importantly how not to infringe on the civil rights of other students. 


This should not be about targeted offices and offloading task force objectives to special interest groups. There is a broader need for this training and support, across all UCLA communities. This issue is a symptom of a much greater problem
at UCLA and likely at universities nationwide. Look at the question that asks about whether you've been barred from a group based on gender, and look at the number of responses. It's time to redefine "academic abuse" that is classically
defined by title IX as an issue between individuals in a romantic relationship. Barring someone from a group based on gender or Title VI, that's academic abuse. Or discrimination from a professor stereotyping someone's heritage and whether 
they're "suited" for research, that's academic abuse. look at the title IX complaints, there are a large number of gender discrimination complaints, and having done the title IX training myself, there is no training on it. there would presumably 
be a larger number of complaints filed if there were. Gender discrimination and gender harassment are almost "more fitting" in the Title VI training as a form of discrimination based on biological or assumed identity that creates a "hostile"
academic environment. And it is extremely confusing for a student to understand and process gender discrimination because Title IX began in the 70's as equal access for women, but is contemporarily mischaracterized as protections relating to 
sexual misconduct. So if people can't categorize it as Tile IX or Title VI, they won't address the problems. and neither the universities nor the office of education care to deepen our understanding because really all of this is put into place 
to address liability concerns. And no oversight body cares to appropriate extra funding towards general Title VI or the aforementioned areas of Title IX because, are racism and sexism "really a problem anymore" if violations have a "low number of 
complaints" to the DOE or a low likelihood of a lawsuit within the statute of limitations? To put it plainly, misconduct has to be "very serious" to get anyone's attention. 


Now we see antisemitism is shining a light on Title VI. While it has the spotlight, we should address the issue of 
discrimination on the basis of race and gender as well. Because if in either the case of antisemitism or discrimination based on race and gender you're dealing with a high volume of "less serious" cases of misconduct that denies equal 
access to an education, *that is very serious*. The world is changing incredibly quickly, it's hard for policy to keep up, and women and minorities are following the same pattern of delayed access that existed in the 70's but in areas like
STEM, and perhaps it isn't just the extra educational support that women and minorities need, perhaps an "inclusive environment" means "soft skills" and "professionalism". Perhaps there are more paths than those to the 
classroom during a protest that are being blocked.  
 
and yet the office of education just awarded UCLA 8 million dollars in funding for issues irrelevant to the wellbeing of its student body...
 
Everyone needs Title VI training, undergraduates, graduate students, professors, administration, everyone. Because academia is a cesspool of toxic behavior with a complete lack of disciplinary action or oversight. There is no HR in academia and 
I guarantee every student would want one---a guide to *professional*, *appropriate*, behavior would be a huge quality of life boost for everyone at this university.

•	NEW: Pro-Palestine protester harasses a Daily Bruin journalist before saying "I hate white people." The woman was live streaming from the UCLA Divest IG account when she made the comment. 
Immediately after saying she "hates white people" the protester threatened to call the journalist "racist" if she wrote about her. In a separate live stream, the protester threatened to "deal with" the 
"U.S. Imperialist States."
