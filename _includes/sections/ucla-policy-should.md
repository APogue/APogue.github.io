Gold also noted in his email that the UC Regents President Michael Drake announced during the meeting that the 10 UC campuses will be partnering with the Hillel Campus Initiative, which Gold called 
“a welcome and necessary step to better address campus antisemitism and take meaningful action to ensure our campuses are free of hate and fully accepting and inclusionary for all Jewish students, faculty and community members.”

According to The Los Angeles Times, one of the issues discussed during the UC Regents meeting was a proposal requiring faculty departments to put any polemical commentary statements up to a vote before posting and clarifying 
who exactly they are speaking on behalf of. The proposal would also require that faculty polemical commentary be posted on a webpage clearly marked as an opinion page that’s not speaking on the behalf of the university. 
The proposal has been tabled until May; when it was first introduced by Regent Jay Sures, pro-Palestinian protesters shouted “shame on you!” and accused Sures of attempting to censor their point of view.

“Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza. In fact, 
it is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land they inhabit.”

The Palestinian student said they were disappointed that an Oct. 13 statement by the chancellor described the Oct. 7 attack as a “grievous act of malice and hate” against Israelis but Palestinian deaths as “loss of life,” as the tonal shift
 emphasizes the violence against Israelis over Palestinians. They added that they feel the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than 
 Palestinian students.
 
 
A UCLA media-relations office with large reach would help to 
control and mediate this conversation. Groups with “extreme” rhetoric underlying what could otherwise be a “worthy cause” to students leaves them no choice but to follow their media pages. 
This page could also pick among student voices that may represent a large portion of the student body but lack media reach, such as Hillel and Chabad. 

“The protesters inside the encampment are also planning on hosting de-escalation workshops for participants to help 
prepare them for the presence of future counter-protesters, Annie said. In a Thursday morning Instagram post, SJP 
had told encampment participants not to engage with counter-protesters. “We are focused on the safety of our people 
and our students, and so that means engaging in tactics of de-escalation,””42

The statue was placed on campus on March 20th and it took until March 28th for UCLA to release a statement. Their solution to its existence was to say it had been removed and refer to UCLA value doctrine and then to "administration-splain" 
that people "should feel comfortable on campus". As a graduate student with very little involvement with campus culture at UCLA and a 2nd generation American of 1/2 Vietnamese and 1/2 Caucasian racial background, I have little to no 
experience with tropes related to this issue. I have literally zero bias, and I can say that if it were directed at me, and the only solution the university could come up with in response to "proudly" hateful imagery is to let me know a week 
late that they "care" and "I should feel good being here" and "it has been removed" I would not feel better at all. The deed has been done, the damage has been done.
