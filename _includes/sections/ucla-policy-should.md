David Myers, a Distinguished Professor at UCLA who holds the Sady and Ludwig Kahn Chair in Jewish History wrote in his op-ed, entitled *Antisemitic imagery at UC Regents meeting protest threatens campus discourse*,
“Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza. In fact, 
it is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land they inhabit.”[^200]

It would be sensible to say, UCLA as an institution should behave like an "individual"; a person with views on matters that permit them to agree and disagree with other views without infringing on anyone's 1st Ammendment rights. 
This individual would be "highly influential" because they are well informed, have abundant resources, and global reach. Take for example, the quote by Dr. Myers. While he, like many influential people, is beholden to stakeholders, 
he found the fortitude and the courage to speak up and take a position in these tumultuous times. Currently, the UCLA "individual" is absent---there have been no positions taken, which is problematic when trying to head off a growing 
problem. In contrast, an individual with convictions can predict the direction of a mounting problem and attempt to course correct using their own personal set of values. But if there's no one around to worry over the direction of UCLA's 
campus climate, if there's no one to say, "I don't like where this is going", then the direction it takes is left in the hands of the young and inexperienced. The outcome is at the cost of the young and inexperienced, because thus far UCLA's weak 
tone and vague policy adherance has caused it to largely function as a "hands-off" governing body students report incidents to and take issue with *after* the damage has been done. The signs that this is how UCLA is functioning are everywhere---

The university took no position on pro-Palestinian messaging during the protests and offered no support to students regarding time, place, and manner restrictions. UCLA (the "individual") needs to be "louder" and more resolute. If UCLA didn't like 
where things were going, it might condemn antisemitic chants. If it didn't like where things were headed, it might say, "blockading students from going to their classes is not protected by the 1st ammendment, and if any student continues this behavior
the encampent will be immediatly shut down." This way, when they're told to vacate because the "encampment is unlawful and violates university policy" the students won't be left confused as to why. The Daily Bruin 
also pointed out that same day that "The university has not previously called the encampment unlawful or unauthorized."[^166] Really the flyer gave the feeling that UCLA just wanted the protest to stop because if they couldn't give a reason for 
shutting them down there must not be one. Which could cause students, already in an agitated state, to stay put out of pure defiance; unwilling to be subject to the complex "legalese" administrators must be conjuring as an excuse to get rid of them. 

Keeping them informed would have resulted in two paths to the same outcome, either students would have stopped the unlawful behavior or they would have continued but understood why they were being shut down, and may have been more willing to vacate. 
In either case, the encampment was not shut down out of fear for students' safety, although in hindsight the administration might look better if that had been its intention. The flyer stated that "law enforcement is on hand to protect and keep safe"
students and demonstrators. But 5 days of weak or absent messaging, then a single flyer and an email at 5:15 pm on the 30th were not enough to head off the mounting tension between protesting sides since day one (see *Timeline* in *Supplementary Information*). 
The result: confused and defiant students fell prey to mounting aggression from non-affiliates while the university carried on, lackadaisical, mute, and unobservant. 

"However one feels about the encampment, this attack on our students, faculty and community members was utterly unacceptable. It has shaken our campus to its core and — adding to other abhorrent incidents that we have witnessed and that have circulated on 
social media over the past several days — further damaged our community's sense of security."[^170] So, Block did not agree with pro-Palestinian rhetoric, fair enough, he's entitled. But "however one feels about the encampment" is exactly the weak, 
too little too late, after the fact individual UCLA has become. It begs the question, UCLA may not agree with its students, but does it care about them, unconditionally? Because communication, rules, and guidance are how to avoid danger befalling them. 
And the lack thereof may seem like the individual cares about American freedoms, when in fact what happened here betrays a darker objective. Without being too dramatic on the matter, this looks like a cut and dry case of administrative negligence to me.  


•	Kohanteb said he feels the university should offer more guidance for students about what constitutes hate speech because he feels some students are ignorant when it comes to antisemitic tropes.
•	“I’m scared sometimes that hate usually comes from ignorance,” he said. “If we can inform students of what is and what isn’t antisemitic, and where that line is, I think it’d be very beneficial to all.”




A UCLA media-relations office with large reach would help to 
control and mediate this conversation. Groups with “extreme” rhetoric underlying what could otherwise be a “worthy cause” to students leaves them no choice but to follow their media pages. 
This page could also pick among student voices that may represent a large portion of the student body but lack media reach, such as Hillel and Chabad. 



come to a consensus on Zionism 


The flyer had good intentions in saying, that "law enforcement is on hand to protect and keep safe" students and demonstrators. However as the Daily Bruin states, "The university has not previously called the encampment unlawful or 
unauthorized."[^166] Really, the messaging was too passive, cryptic, and the email came too late to effectively communicate cases of misconduct and the urgency of the matter. It is likely that the UCLA administration did not themselves realize 
the urgency, despite mounting tension between protesting sides since day one (see *Timeline* in *Supplementary Information*). Regardless, the efforts to clear the encampment administratively was weak, unclear, and likely left protesters confused. 
As for counterprotesters, listing off a bunch of codes was unlikely to help them understand the consequences of their actions either. Although judging from their behavior it likely wouldn't have mattered either way. 


Some Jewish organizations on campus, such as Hillel at UCLA, have published statements condemning the harassment of students with opposing views on the war. Kian Kohanteb, a 
third-year political science student who is a member of the leadership of several Jewish organizations on campus, said multiple organizations have published guidelines ahead of rallies 
supporting Israel that advise all protestors to avoid Islamophobia.----where is the university on this?
safety -----------------------------------------------------------

However, there have been allegations of Islamophobia during and after a rally held Nov. 7 in support of Israel. In a post on Instagram, the Undergraduate Students Association Council’s Cultural Affairs Commission 
claimed that Zionist protesters harassed, threatened and assaulted students who were showing support for Palestine on the same day as the rally.


"Over the course of our hours on the front lines, I estimate that more than 90% of the verbal and physical instigation came from the agitated counterdemonstrators, a fair number of whom spoke Hebrew and appeared to 
come from outside campus. The anti-war group had yellow-vested personnel who maintained discipline and sought to deescalate when the threat of violence arose."

"But even they were greeted with insulting words from the other side, as were members of a small contingent of a local chapter of Standing Together who came 
bearing signs calling for peace and equality for Palestinians and Jews."

•	“Brannon said while she appreciates that the administration has made statements in support of Jewish students, she feels there is more that it could do. She added that she has heard of instances of Jewish students not receiving responses to complaints 
they sent to the UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.”

Gold also noted in his email that the UC Regents President Michael Drake announced during the meeting that the 10 UC campuses will be partnering with the Hillel Campus Initiative, which Gold called 
“a welcome and necessary step to better address campus antisemitism and take meaningful action to ensure our campuses are free of hate and fully accepting and inclusionary for all Jewish students, faculty and community members.”


According to The Los Angeles Times, one of the issues discussed during the UC Regents meeting was a proposal requiring faculty departments to put any polemical commentary statements up to a vote before posting and clarifying 
who exactly they are speaking on behalf of. The proposal would also require that faculty polemical commentary be posted on a webpage clearly marked as an opinion page that’s not speaking on the behalf of the university. 
The proposal has been tabled until May; when it was first introduced by Regent Jay Sures, pro-Palestinian protesters shouted “shame on you!” and accused Sures of attempting to censor their point of view.

The statue was placed on campus on March 20th and it took until March 28th for UCLA to release a statement. Their solution to its existence was to say it had been removed and refer to UCLA value doctrine and then to "administration-splain" 
that people "should feel comfortable on campus". I have little to no experience with tropes related to this issue. I have zero bias, and I can say that if it were directed at me, and the only solution the university could come up with in 
response to "proudly" hateful imagery is to let me know a week late that "it has been removed" and they "care" and "I should feel good being here" I would not feel better at all. The deed has been done, the damage has been done.

•	NEW: Pro-Palestine protester harasses a Daily Bruin journalist before saying "I hate white people." The woman was live streaming from the UCLA Divest IG account when she made the comment. 
Immediately after saying she "hates white people" the protester threatened to call the journalist "racist" if she wrote about her. In a separate live stream, the protester threatened to "deal with" the 
"U.S. Imperialist States."

“The protesters inside the encampment are also planning on hosting de-escalation workshops for participants to help 
prepare them for the presence of future counter-protesters, Annie said. In a Thursday morning Instagram post, SJP 
had told encampment participants not to engage with counter-protesters. “We are focused on the safety of our people 
and our students, and so that means engaging in tactics of de-escalation,””42

Also the office of education needs to update their hatespeech vocab, it's not just swastikas anymore


52 minutes talks about doe youtube

how big is the problem? go into the excel data here...

why are microgroups being targeted, that exist along an axis of discrimination against one another, and why is this the microcosm for the greater university environment? The entire university needs training, 




This should not be about targeted offices and offloading task force objectives to special interest groups. There is a broader need for this training and support, across all UCLA communities. This issue is a symptom of a much greater problem
at UCLA and likely at universities nationwide. Look at the question that asks about whether you've been barred from a group based on gender, and look at the number of responses. It's time to redefine "academic abuse" that is classically
defined by title IX as an issue between individuals in a romantic relationship. Barring someone from a group based on gender or Title VI, that's academic abuse. Or discrimination from a professor stereotyping someone's heritage and whether 
they're "suited" for research, that's academic abuse. look at the title IX complaints, there are a large number of gender discrimination complaints, and having done the title IX training myself, there is no training on it. there would presumably 
be a larger number of complaints filed if there were. Gender discrimination and gender harassment are almost "more fitting" in the Title VI training as a form of discrimination based on biological or assumed identity that creates a "hostile"
academic environment. And it is extremely confusing for a student to understand and process gender discrimination because Title IX began in the 70's as equal access for women, but is contemporarily mischaracterized as protections relating to 
sexual misconduct. So if people can't categorize it as Tile IX or Title VI, they won't address the problems. and neither the universities nor the office of education care to deepen our understanding because really all of this is put into place 
to address liability concerns. And no oversight body cares to appropriate extra funding towards general Title VI or the aforementioned areas of Title IX because, are racism and sexism "really a problem anymore" if violations have a "low number of 
complaints" to the DOE or a low likelihood of a lawsuit within the statute of limitations? To put it plainly, misconduct has to be "very serious" to get anyone's attention. 


Now we see antisemitism is shining a light on Title VI. While it has the spotlight, we should address the issue of 
discrimination on the basis of race and gender as well. Because if in either the case of antisemitism or discrimination based on race and gender you're dealing with a high volume of "less serious" cases of misconduct that denies equal 
access to an education, *that is very serious*. The world is changing incredibly quickly, it's hard for policy to keep up, and women and minorities are following the same pattern of delayed access that existed in the 70's but in areas like
STEM, and perhaps it isn't just the extra educational support that women and minorities need, perhaps an "inclusive environment" means "soft skills" and "professionalism". Perhaps there are more paths than those to the 
classroom during a protest that are being blocked.  
 
and yet the office of education just awarded UCLA 8 million dollars in funding for issues irrelevant to the wellbeing of its student body...
 
Everyone needs Title VI training, undergraduates, graduate students, professors, administration, everyone. Because academia is a cesspool of toxic behavior with a complete lack of disciplinary action or oversight. There is no HR in academia and 
I guarantee every student would want one---a guide to *professional*, *appropriate*, behavior would be a huge quality of life boost for everyone at this university.
