- "By 8:30 p.m., around 30 of the counter-protesters remained, with a dozen of them encircled by members of the encampment. Around 9 p.m., following aggressive interactions between encampment participants and counter-protesters, a pro-Palestine protester was carried away from Dickson Plaza with a heavily bandaged ankle. Most of the counter-protesters dispersed by 10 p.m."[^1]

- "Just before 5 p.m., a counter-protester with a sign that read "Israel is not apartheid" entered the encampment. Around 15 minutes later, they got into a shoving match with a protester inside, whose sign read "Israeli BEYOND Horrified by Apartheid State.""[^1]

- "More counter-protesters gathered, with nearly 50 people there shortly before 7 p.m. Some waving megaphones shouted at students, who they called "terrorists," to "show your face.""[^1]

#### 4/26
- "An individual waving an Israeli flag also began playing loud music from around 4:40 a.m. to around 5:30 a.m. and shouted at people inside the encampment to "wake up." One encampment leader asked them to turn the music off, leading to light shoving, and private security personnel hired by the campus spoke to both parties."[^2]

- "It's also important to note that we are following University of California systemwide policy guidance, which directs us not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community."[^3]

- "The protesters inside the encampment are also planning on hosting de-escalation workshops for participants to help prepare them for the presence of future counter-protesters, Annie said. In a Thursday morning Instagram post, SJP had told encampment participants not to engage with counter-protesters. "We are focused on the safety of our people and our students, and so that means engaging in tactics of de-escalation,""[^2]

#### 4/27
- "Due to a student having a severe banana allergy within the encampment, all food is vetted for bananas before entering the food supply, Salem said. On Friday, counter-protesters were seen waving bananas in the air after hearing about the student's allergy. "Agitators were threatening to sexually assault a student with a banana after hearing that there's a deadly banana allergy in the encampment," he said. "The Zionists were told of this by the security and then waved bananas at us.""[^4]

- "The counter-protesters also attempted to engage with Daily Bruin reporters at the scene by yelling at them and calling one a sexist slur through megaphones, as well as following and recording them. "Don't be an idiot. No recording," one counter-protester said to a reporter."[^5]

- ""UCLA's approach to the encampment is guided by several equally important principles: the need to support the safety and well-being of Bruins, the need to support the free expression rights of our community, and the need to minimize disruption to our teaching and learning mission," Osako said in the statement. "These same long-standing principles have allowed UCLA to uphold a history of peaceful protest.""[^6]

- "Adam Tfayli, the Undergraduate Students Association Council international student representative, alleged that he and others around him were threatened with a knife around 1 a.m.  "I went and I told one of the CSC (UCLA's private security) officers. He really didn't do anything. They didn't care," Tfayli said. "I think it just speaks to UCLA and how UCLA's responding, and how it's not protecting its students.""[^5]

#### 4/28
- "Thousands of people demonstrated in Dickson Plaza after a convergence of four protests began Sunday morning, days after a pro-Palestinian encampment started in front of Royce Hall on Thursday."[^7]

- "Osako said in the statement. "As an institution of higher education, we stand firmly for the idea that even when we disagree, we must still engage respectfully and recognize one another's humanity. We are dismayed that certain individuals instead chose to jeopardize the physical safety of the community.""[^8]

- "Graeme Blair, an associate professor of political science inside the encampment, said in a statement sent over text message that he believes counter-protesters were attempting to start conflicts with members of the encampment. Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine at UCLA, added that he believes there is a risk of people misreading the situation and using any alleged violence as an excuse for a police shutdown of the encampment."[^8]

- "Hezkiya added in the statement that multiple demonstrators supporting Israel had to receive medical attention after altercations in Dickson Plaza."[^8]

#### 4/29
- "The dual student and faculty rallies – led by Faculty for Justice in Palestine and Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA – began at noon in front of Bunche Hall. Hundreds of faculty – holding signs with slogans such as "Let Gaza live" and "FJP is proud of SJP"– entered the encampment, while hundreds more students forced their way into Royce Hall through the back doors and filed out from the front, lining up under the building's arches to listen to faculty and student speeches."[^9]

- "Nathan, an organizer of a pro-Israel counter-protest that raised more than $82,000 on GoFundMe, said his group's demonstrations were aimed at educating people about the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Although the counter-protest originally received a permit from the university to use loudspeakers and a large screen, the equipment remained, playing music and videos overnight and on Monday morning without permission."[^9]

- ""The big screen on the east lawn of Royce Quad is not permitted, and there are no current plans to remove it," said UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez in a written statement."[^9]

- "Doehr said pro-Israel counter-protesters have threatened and harassed students, including by using racist and misogynistic remarks – some of which Daily Bruin reporters have witnessed. Counter-protesters have also used similarly discriminatory language when addressing a Daily Bruin reporter, calling them a sexist slur and threatening them early Sunday morning."[^9]

- "In addition to the candidates and officers at the encampment, tents with the logos of Verdugo’s office and the Campus Events Commission were present. Campus Events Commissioner Mason Miller did not respond to requests for comment. It is unclear if funds from USAC offices are being used to fund resources at the demonstration, but the text "PAID FOR BY USAC" is visible on the Cultural Affairs Commission tent."[^10]

- "Eli Tsives, a candidate for general representative, was part of the counter-protest against the encampment. Tsives, who alleged the encampment was promoting hate speech, criticized Verdugo's use of her platform to promote messages he believes makes Jewish students uncomfortable on campus."[^10]

#### 4/30
- "Around 60 counter-protesters attempted to breach the entrance of the encampment in Dickson Plaza around midnight Tuesday morning, drawing the presence of six UCPD officers in riot gear."[^11]

- "UCLA released a letter Tuesday to those inside the pro-Palestine encampment in Dickson Plaza saying their protest is "unlawful and violates university policy" and could result in suspension or expulsion."[^12]

- "The statement said it is illegal for non-UCLA affiliated individuals to take part in the encampment, and doing so can result in a misdemeanor charge. The statement said these individuals should depart the campus immediately."[^12]

- "The statement also bans non-UCLA affiliated individuals from masking, camping or bringing large signs over 30-by-30 inches to campus. Counter-protesters of the demonstration in Dickson Plaza had previously set up a large video screen and sound system that remains in the area as of Tuesday, though the permit has expired."[^12]

- "Block said the university has initiated the student conduct process to investigate those who prevented other students from accessing parts of campus."[^13]

- "UC Divest Coalition at UCLA said in a written press release that it believes violence on campus was caused primarily by counter-protesters supporting Israel, some of whom the protesters allege threatened them with weapons. They added that they believe the administration has failed to protect students on campus."[^13]

- ""Every day that I've been at the encampment, what I've seen is an extraordinary show of solidarity between Jewish students, Muslim students, students from Palestine and students from around the world who are concerned about how the United States and Israel are treating Palestinians," he said.  "I haven't seen any anti-semitism.""[^13]

- "At the end of the statement, Block encouraged campus community members to report instances of discrimination to UCLA's Civil Rights Office and to call UCPD if they feel in danger."[^13]

#### 5/1
- "Fireworks, tear gas and fights broke out just after 10:50 p.m. Tuesday night and continued early Wednesday morning as around 100 pro-Israel counter-protesters attempted to seize the barricade around and storm the ongoing Palestine solidarity encampment in Dickson Plaza."[^14]

- "At around 10:50 p.m., counter-protest

ers – who had been gathering around the encampment since that afternoon – began wrestling with protesters inside and CSC security hired by UCLA over the metal barricades surrounding the Gaza solidarity encampment. The barriers came down shortly afterward, and counter-protesters wearing masks then began shoving the wooden boards surrounding the encampment, attempting to topple them onto the protesters inside."[^14]

- "The UC Divest spokesperson also said that as of midnight, they had not seen or heard from any police on site. LAPD did not respond to a request for comment, and UCPD said it was not able to offer comment because all officers were tied up dealing with protesters."[^14]

#### 5/1
- "Around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, four Bruin reporters were physically assaulted outside Kaplan Hall while trying to leave the area around Dickson Plaza."[^15]

- "Wednesday classes were already canceled "due to the distress caused by the violence that took place on Royce Quad," according to a BruinAlert sent at 8:02 a.m. that day. UCLA Health facilities, the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center and the university's PreK-12 schools remain open, UCLA said in the alert."[^16]

- "In a statement sent at 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday to the UCLA community, Chancellor Gene Block said outside instigators came to Dickson Plaza to attack the encampment Tuesday evening. He added that the university had requested police forces to come to campus to address the attacks, and that it "will conduct a thorough investigation that may lead to arrests, expulsions and dismissals.""[^16]

- ""However one feels about the encampment, this attack on our students, faculty and community members was utterly unacceptable," he said in the statement. "It has shaken our campus to its core and — adding to other abhorrent incidents that we have witnessed and that have circulated on social media over the past several days — further damaged our community's sense of security.""[^17][^18]

- "Block also encouraged people to report incidents of violence to UCPD and discrimination to the Civil Rights Office, as well as using campus counseling resources. LAPD officers remained in Dickson Plaza as of 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday."[^16]

- "Students expressed support for UCLA's decision to transition to remote classes for the remainder of the week…Many students said they appreciated UCLA's choice to pivot to remote classes because they did not feel safe on campus."[^19]

- ""Especially after seeing all the videos from last night, you just don't know who's there or what weapons they may have," she said. "A lot of people that aren't students were coming in, so that's kind of scary.""[^19]

- "United Auto Workers Local 4811 – formerly known as the two unions UAW Local 2865 and UAW Local 5810 – which represents University of California academic student employees and graduate student, academic and postdoctoral researchers, announced in a press release Wednesday afternoon that it voted to hold a strike authorization vote as soon as next week."[^20]

- "The California Federation of Teachers, the California affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers, and the University Council-AFT, which represent educators and classified professionals, and UC librarians and non-Senate faculty, respectively, released a statement calling for UCLA Chancellor Gene Block's resignation."[^21]

#### 5/2
- "By 1:20 a.m. Thursday, police officers began sweeping the encampment, with their first detainment of a protester occurring at 1:55 a.m."[^22]

- "Blair said in a texted statement sent around 3:45 a.m. that student protesters were "violently dragged" from the encampment by CHP officers. He added that some students were visibly injured, and stun grenades were used while officers pointed guns loaded with less-than-lethal rounds at students – both of which faculty present demanded officers cease to use."[^22]

#### 5/5
- "Chancellor Gene Block announced Sunday that the university has created a new Office of Campus Safety, which will manage UCPD and the Office of Emergency Management."[^24]

- "The change moves the oversight of UCPD and campus safety operations away from the office of Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck to the new office."[^24]

- "The Office of Campus Safety will be led by inaugural Associate Vice Chancellor Rick Braziel, who has worked in public safety for more than 30 years, according to the email announcement. He served as the chief of police for the Sacramento Police department from 2008 to 2012 and has been an instructor at California State University, Humboldt since 2000."[^24]

- ""In the past week, our campus has been shaken by events that have disturbed this sense of safety and strained trust within our community. In light of this, both UCLA and the UC Office of the President have committed to a thorough investigation of our security processes," Block said in the email. "But one thing is already clear: To best protect our community moving forward, urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations.""[^24][^25]
