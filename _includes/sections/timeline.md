- "The protesters inside the encampment are also planning on hosting de-escalation workshops for participants to help prepare them for the presence of future counter-protesters, Annie said.

#### 4/27

- "Adam Tfayli, the Undergraduate Students Association Council international student representative, alleged that he and others around him were threatened with a knife around 1 a.m.  "I went and I told one of the CSC (UCLA's private security) officers.

- "Doehr said pro-Israel counter-protesters have threatened and harassed students, including by using racist and misogynistic remarks – some of which Daily Bruin reporters have witnessed.

- "At around 10:50 p.m., counter-protesters – who had been gathering around the encampment since that afternoon – began wrestling with protesters inside and CSC security hired by UCLA over the metal barricades surrounding the Gaza solidarity encampment. The barriers came down shortly afterward, and counter-protesters wearing masks then began shoving the wooden boards surrounding the encampment, attempting to topple them onto the protesters inside."[^14]

- "The UC Divest spokesperson also said that as of midnight, they had not seen or heard from any police on site. LAPD did not respond to a request for comment, and UCPD said it was not able to offer comment because all officers were tied up dealing with protesters."[^14]

- "Students expressed support for UCLA's decision to transition to remote classes for the remainder of the week…Many students said they appreciated UCLA's choice to pivot to remote classes because they did not feel safe on campus."[^19]

- ""Especially after seeing all the videos from last night, you just don't know who's there or what weapons they may have," she said. "A lot of people that aren't students were coming in, so that's kind of scary.""[^19]

- "Chancellor Gene Block released a statement Thursday afternoon claiming that the Palestine solidarity encampment had been shut down because it led to unsafe university conditions and interfered with UCLA's educational mission."[^23]
