## USAC Involvement 
"The Undergraduate Students Association Council passed a resolution Tuesday night calling for the resignation of
Chancellor Gene Block if he does not meet the demands of the Palestine solidarity encampment.

By a 10-3 vote, the council voted to pass the “Resolution Calling for the Immediate Resignation of Chancellor Gene Block 
if He Does Not Meet PSE Divestment Demands, Grant Amnesty to Affected Students, and Waive Medical Bills of Those Hospitalized.” 
Cultural Affairs commissioner Alicia Verdugo sponsored the resolution – which passed following a tense debate – with international 
student representative Adam Tfayli and general representative Jonathan Valenzuela Mejia as co-sponsors."[^42]

Regardless of what the demands are, should a student governing body that is funded and elected by all students be taking part in these resolutions? If 
the best course of action is for the voting students to hold those that don't represent them accountable, then I have to ask whether a USAC organization commissioner
that partakes the display of antisemitic imagery on the public facing account of the organization should be permitted to sponsor such resolutions? The imagery on CAC's instagram
website shows a clear bias against Jewish students and the activity of this commissioner should be called into question. 



 ""As someone who identifies very strongly with their indigenous identity to Mexico, I very much sympathize with the ongoing fight for Palestinian liberation, as they're indigenous to their homeland and are currently being displaced," 
 [Javier Nuñez-Verdugo, a candidate for external vice president] said."

## Backlash
{: .custom-section-header}

"A woman scheduled to graduate this month from UCLA sued the University of California Regents Monday, alleging the university did not protect her and other Jewish 
students and faculty members from what the suit labels "campus terrorists'' during recent campus protests over Israel's military efforts in Gaza.


...Hamas-leaning faculty members offered extra credit and better grades for those who took part in the "chaos and disruption caused by the campus terrorists,'' 
all with the university's knowledge and consent, the suit alleges.

...According to Nitka's diary, a portion of which is included in the suit, during her Chicano studies class last fall her professor was "blatantly attacking Zionist identity"[^43]
during class, even though the course subject does not align with the topic of the Israel-Palestine conflict.''
