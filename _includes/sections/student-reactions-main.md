{: .custom-section-header}
"The Undergraduate Students Association Council passed a resolution Tuesday night calling for the resignation of
Chancellor Gene Block if he does not meet the demands of the Palestine solidarity encampment.

By a 10-3 vote, the council voted to pass the “Resolution Calling for the Immediate Resignation of Chancellor Gene Block 
if He Does Not Meet PSE Divestment Demands, Grant Amnesty to Affected Students, and Waive Medical Bills of Those Hospitalized.” 
Cultural Affairs commissioner Alicia Verdugo sponsored the resolution – which passed following a tense debate – with international 
student representative Adam Tfayli and general representative Jonathan Valenzuela Mejia as co-sponsors."[^42]

 ""As someone who identifies very strongly with their indigenous identity to Mexico, I very much sympathize with the ongoing fight for Palestinian liberation, as they're indigenous to their homeland and are currently being displaced," 
 [Javier Nuñez-Verdugo, a candidate for external vice president] said."

## Backlash
{: .custom-section-header}

"A woman scheduled to graduate this month from UCLA sued the University of California Regents Monday, alleging the university did not protect her and other Jewish 
students and faculty members from what the suit labels "campus terrorists'' during recent campus protests over Israel's military efforts in Gaza.


...Hamas-leaning faculty members offered extra credit and better grades for those who took part in the "chaos and disruption caused by the campus terrorists,'' 
all with the university's knowledge and consent, the suit alleges.

...According to Nitka's diary, a portion of which is included in the suit, during her Chicano studies class last fall her professor was "blatantly attacking Zionist identity"[^43]
during class, even though the course subject does not align with the topic of the Israel-Palestine conflict.''

A reoccurring theme here is that students are curious and interested to learn and share their knowledge. One would assume that the same goes for any forum where they are able to interact without fear of repercussion. 
It isn’t enough to say, “don’t be antisemitic” or “don’t use this word or that word”. They want to share their personal identities and views, and they want to learn. Without guidance and insight, they are directing these 
conversations on their own. If you tell them “don’t do it”, they will find an open forum, and do it anyways. The Reddit community gives insight into the student’s opinions, gaps in understanding, curiosity, the support they 
need, and the concerns they have. The post dates vary, but approximately coincide with protest dates (April 25th - May 6th).
