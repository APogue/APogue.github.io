## r/UCLA 
{: .custom-section-header}
I see reddit as a virtual structure with lots of rooms; I walk down its hallways and can hear the animated chatter of its members, and sometimes I pause to listen and learn. 
This Reddit community gives insight into student’s opinions, gaps in understanding, curiosity, the support they need, and the concerns they have. The dates of posts shown here vary, but most approximately coincide with protest 
dates (April 25th - May 6th). Before moving through the content in the r/UCLA section please understand these are open forums for anonymous discussion. The content and views expressed in this section are the 
views of the posters only. I attempted to extract commentary from all perspectives regardless of the language used, or how critical or controversial the perspective may be. The idea was to investigate what students were thinking
and feeling in as honest a way as possible, without a filter. That being said, reddit may attract a certain "type" of person from the UCLA community or beyond, so it is not to be assumed that this is an accurate sampling of UCLA viewpoints. 
It is simply "a window" into the thoughts of some people from within the r/UCLA community. 

Themes offering valuable lessons range from aspects of the protest that caused backlash, confusion over what the overall protest message was, conversations about cultural identity, and the opinions of people
not personally involved who are expressing a "neutral" or moderate take. The posts range from excellent examples of how to process these tense and emotional times to counterproductive or showing animosity
for opposing viewpoints. Regardless of the nature of the conversation, people come to the table to take part in a dialogue without being discouraged, which is commendable given our current political climate and a lesson in and of itself.

Specifically, beginning with [figure block](##fig:backlash-1), we see "chuu26" confused about what protester's intentions are when they block the pathways of "all" students. It's important to understand that when a "targeted" group falls
within a greater group being denied access to their education via blockading pathways, etc., this may be a deliberate device for denying that group their Title VI protected rights. It is not enough to say "we all were denied", and regardless 
this activity forfeits 1st Ammendment protections. I was also somewhat surprised to see how much students disliked when protesters blocked pathways ([blocked path](##fig:backlash-2), etc.), it was much more than a mild inconvenience to them. Students
should be made aware of what behavior can cause backlash and undermine their cause. They also need help understanding what their 1st ammendment rights are and what categories of behavior denies them protections ([figures](##fig:1st-Ammendment-1)).

We also see "chuu26" in some way "aligning" with the pro-Palestinian movement as a "person of color". Other examples where this was observed, 

""As someone who identifies very strongly with their indigenous identity to Mexico, I very much sympathize with the ongoing fight for Palestinian liberation, as they're indigenous to their homeland and are currently being displaced," 
[Javier Nuñez-Verdugo, a candidate for external vice president] said."[^44]
 
"According to Nitka's diary,...during her Chicano studies class last fall her professor was "blatantly attacking Zionist identity" during class, even though the course subject does not align with the topic of the Israel-Palestine conflict."[^43]


It would be beneficial for students and faculty to learn they must evaluate the message of a protest *before* aggregating with it based on personal identity. Conversations in r/UCLA rightly ask, "what does Palestinian liberation" as 
Nuñez-Verdugo stated, mean exactly? As TheRealMichaelE put it, "The issue I have with the Free Palestine movement is I don't know what it means. There are definitely a lot of people in the movement that just want peace, equality, and reparations
for Palestinians. There are also people in the movement that suport Oct 7th and Hamas." ([fig](##fig:confusion-over-the-message-of-the-movement-1)). When students lead with identity, a theme we see on the national level with identity politics, we
are forced to assume the rest, which could range in messaging from moderate to extreme. 

There does seem to be a great deal of confusion on what words or phrases constitute hatespeech or speech intended to intimidate a specific group on campus. Phrases like "From the River to the Sea" ([figure](##fig:backlash-3)), 
"intifada" ([fig](##fig:confusion-over-the-message-of-the-movement-8)), and "Zionist" ([fig](##fig:debating-zionism-4)) have become part of heated semantic debates. On top of these debates are students arguing for or against the 
inclusivity of the protest movement ([fig](##fig:confusion-over-the-message-of-the-movement-2)), because no one really understands what anyone stands for. Not the university, not the individual organizations, and not the majority of 
the protesters. It is essential for UCLA to qualify these statements, do they condemn their use?

""I couldn't believe that my faculty colleagues wanted to criminalize terms like 'intifada.' They wanted to ban the wearing of the keffiyeh," Roy said. "We don't have to agree. We should not agree intellectually or ideologically or 
politically. That is not the point of university life. But we should not be in the business … of criminalizing the viewpoints we disagree with.""[^144]

In [figure](##fig:polarized-debate-6) "BurgersAndRootbeer" states, "Edit" btw intifada just means uprising against the ocupation it doesn't mean to "kill all Jews" like what some people believe. It's an Arabic word that literally means
"to shake off"". 

What we see in the above [figure](##fig:pal-actionus) and quotes are non-affiliated organizations, students and faculty trying to moderate the conversation around language. I have had a Jewish recent graduate personally tell me she heard 
chants of "from the river to the sea" when she went to the protest to see everything going on. She went on to say that it was "okay" and "understandable" to her. From what I've read on Instagram ([fig](##fig:cac-instagram-post-2), 
[fig](##fig:sjp-insta-letter-regents-1), [fig](##fig:sjp-insta-letter-regents-2)), r/UCLA ([fig](##fig:confusion-over-the-message-of-the-movement-8), [fig](##fig:backlash-3 ), 
[fig](##fig:confusion-over-the-message-of-the-movement-3)), the Daily Bruin[^146][^145], and what I heard directly from a member of the UCLA community, these chants, wording, and phrases are appearing everywhere in the daily lives of Bruins.
Based on the various channels of delivery I would say that qualifies as *pervasive*, and given the number of reactions from Bruins and posts I've observed, that qualifies as happening *repeatedly*. 

“Bella Brannon, the student president of Hillel at UCLA, said she has seen a swastika carved into a tree on campus and experienced people making comments that perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes during meetings.”[^145]

“Seeing so many students not being able to conceptualize that what they’re saying is antisemitic and is wrong is tough,” Brannon said.[^145]

The above quotes come from a Bruin article published on Nov 19th. So it is known that tactics involving the harassment and intimidation of Jewish students have been going on for a long time. What's worse is, because these phrases go 
unqualified, students are left isolated and alone to process their meaning or the intentions behind the words. The unqualification itself lends to the pervasiveness, where students who are naive or have good intentions may not
understand the consequences of their use. The result is, those who are "hurt" by the words are either forced to succumb to them by peer pressure or they're left feeling like they have to hide their feelings to avoid backlash. 
When these instances of congnitive and emotional dissonance are happening not just online and during protests, but "during meetings", this immediately points to clear Title VI violations.

The administration's failing to offer any guidance or opinion on the conflict has caused problems spanning the political spectrum. *Especially* now, to ignore the concerning rise in the Palestinian civilian death toll is a failure in rhetoric,

“What I would like to see in the administration and what I think the administration will ever do is not the same,” they said. “I just hoped from the beginning for just a general statement of, 
‘Any acts of hate or violence toward anybody will not be tolerated.’”[^147]

"The Palestinian student said they were disappointed that an Oct. 13 statement by the chancellor described the Oct. 7 attack as a “grievous act of malice and hate” against Israelis but Palestinian deaths as “loss of life,” as the tonal shift
emphasizes the violence against Israelis over Palestinians. They added that they feel the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than 
Palestinian students."[^147]

The sentiments of the Bruin above are further supported by [fig](##fig:anti-Muslim-6) and [fig](##fig:anti-Muslim-3). It is clear by the repeated concerns of these students that their grievences are going unaddressed. In full context, 
this is an extremely nuanced, emotional, and personal issue for anyone directly involved. Time, care, and feedback should be involved in better representing all UCLA communitites during these times. Perhaps releasing
statements that have been "pre-approved" by all interested party representatives would lead to a more inclusive environment, students with less stress and anxiety, and a student body with greater appreciation for their administration. 

## USAC Involvement 
{: .custom-section-header}

On 5/7 the Daily Bruin wrote,
"The Undergraduate Students Association Council passed a resolution Tuesday night calling for the resignation of
Chancellor Gene Block if he does not meet the demands of the Palestine solidarity encampment."[^42]

"By a 10-3 vote, the council voted to pass the “Resolution Calling for the Immediate Resignation of Chancellor Gene Block 
if He Does Not Meet PSE Divestment Demands, Grant Amnesty to Affected Students, and Waive Medical Bills of Those Hospitalized.” 
Cultural Affairs commissioner Alicia Verdugo sponsored the resolution – which passed following a tense debate – with international 
student representative Adam Tfayli and general representative Jonathan Valenzuela Mejia as co-sponsors."[^42]

Regardless of what the demands are, should a student governing body that is funded and elected by all students be taking part in these resolutions? If 
the best course of action is for the voting students to hold those that don't represent them accountable, then I have to ask whether a USAC organization commissioner (CAC)
that partakes the display of antisemitic imagery on the public facing account of the organization should be permitted to sponsor such resolutions? The imagery on CAC's instagram
website shows a clear bias against Jewish students and the activity of this commissioner should be called into question. 

Minutes and officer reports from USAC dated May 21st can be found here.[^148][^149]

The above statement by the CAC dated May 13th notably states that "the Cultural Afairs Commission has, is, and forever will be an organization that stands with the collective liberation for all marginalized communities." From my observations, 
the CAC finds the promotion of "marginalized" communities to be synonymous with the bullying and harassment of the Jewish community. It finds the promotion of one to be mutually exclusive with the *inclusion* and *representation* of another. 
Most worrisome are comments such as "incredible statement. taught me a lot. thank you for carefully putting this together, all the resources, and the excellent example you have set." If we're being honest, 
what example have they set? And is it consistent with the mission statement ([fig](##fig:cac-org-website)) of a USAC organization that's been operating on behalf of UCLA students for more than 50 years?

## My Reaction
{: .custom-section-header}

Repeated threatening language in the form of chants, physically blocking access to areas on campus, hateful imagery, using social media as a propoganda tool, and parntering with a corrupt student gov't *are* almost certainly pervasive, repeated 
civil rights violations under Title VI. These activities together have created a systematic device for the bullying and harrassment of students based on shared ancestry. It is gaslighting behavior and morally questionable 
to use the strife of *any ethnic group* as a justification for systematic hate. And while it is easy to root for a righteous cause, most of us know no issue is morally absolute; so the protest goes on, with many 
confused about the true ideological crux of the movement. What is the crux? Well the issues we take up with our government funding a war, with investments in the military-industrial complex, these are *American issues* we have a right to 
question. But to entangle American students in a conversation about whether Israel should exist perhaps should be saved for an intellectual forum or the classroom, because it does not make sense in an *American* protest. 
And it is the conflating of these *morally justifiable* issues with those that are both *futile* and outside of our power as Americans that brings Americans to the table only to be disillusioned by so much misplaced hate and anger. To put it in simple
terms, all the extra "anger baggage" undermines your cause; hurting those you seek to help. 

The same is absolutely true of the non-affiliates, they violated the Title VI rights of students on campus and measures absolutely need to be taken in the future to *immediately* remove a perpetrator from campus the moment they cross the line. 
But it is incumbant upon UCLA to take steps to help the student body from within and that means taking measures to prevent abuse and harrassment of its students in any shape or form. A first step is to distill the issues---none 
should detract from or serve as justification for another---i.e. the gross negligence by the university in failing to aid students under attack is *its own* issue, and condemning students using political motivations as "a right" to abuse 
other students is *its own* issue. This applies to any group of shared ancestry or group that identifies with one of shared ancestry. It would be a failure on the part of this paper and deeply hypocritical to say "a problematic" protest is all 
that matters. These isssues have been happening on campus for months and no student deserves to be abused or harrassed, Jewish or Muslim.
