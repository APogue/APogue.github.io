The protest events and events happening on campuses nationwide this academic year have administrators promising antisemitism task forces, specialists in antisemitism, 
and the bolstering of antisemitism components of anti-discrimination training. 

UCLA Hillel Executive Director Dan Gold wrote to community members in March saying "the UC Regents President Michael Drake announced...that the 10 UC campuses will be 
partnering with the Hillel Campus Initiative, which Gold called “a welcome and necessary step to better address campus antisemitism and take meaningful action to ensure our campuses are free of hate and fully accepting and inclusionary
for all Jewish students, faculty and community members.”[^206]

While it is clear that antisemitism training would benefit Jewish students, it is unclear whether training in antisemitism is sufficient to remedy *all* existing civil rights issues on campuses nationwide. It is unclear because there has been 
no effort to find out, and thus far both the university and the national civil rights offices have been gauging issues via filed complaints. Just because the complaints aren't numerous, however, does not mean that the problem with antisemitism
 is not part of a much larger problem looming beneath the surface. To illustrate, in engineering we want a working "closed loop". Here we can define a "feedback loop" as a system of conveying information to students regarding Title VI 
"awareness" and how to report such that when an issue arises they are empowered to file a complaint as their "feedback". In a correctly working loop, the oversight body would modify its behavior based on the volume of complaints, and the 
loop is effectively "closed". If there are few enough "general" Title VI complaints being filed, such that we can maintain the status quo, is correlation causation? Or is the "loop" broken? And are we surveying students adequately enough to know?

Perhaps efforts shouldn't just be about targeted offices and offloading task force objectives to special interest groups. At least not until it is known whether there is a broader need for this training and support across all UCLA communities. 
Looking at [figure](##fig:ucues-ucla-site-1) and [figure](##fig:ucues-ucla-site-2), in the years 2016-2020, the data relating to being "excluded from a study group" based on diversity characteristics is not qualitatively insignificant. Moreover the 
fact that the result stayed approximately the same over 6 years is corroborating evidence that this was in fact happening. Title IX classically defines "academic abuse" as an issue between individuals in a romantic relationship. 
But barring someone from a group based on gender or Title VI looks a lot like academic abuse; or discrimination from a professor---who receives no Title VI training---stereotyping someone's heritage and whether 
they're "suited" for research ([fig](##fig:reddit-black-bruins-2)), that's academic abuse. Looking at the Title IX complaints in [figure](##fig:dpo-investigations-title-ix), there are a large number of gender discrimination complaints, 
and having done the Title IX training myself, there is no training on it. There would presumably be a larger number of complaints filed if there were (yes to start, more might be indicative of a "working" loop). In fact gender discrimination and gender harassment would be 
"more fitting" in Title VI training as a form of discrimination based on biological or assumed identity that creates a "hostile" academic environment. A student might struggle to understand and process gender 
discrimination because Title IX began in the 70's as equal access for women, but is contemporarily mischaracterized as protections relating to sexual misconduct.[^203][^204] So if people can't categorize an incident as Tile IX or Title VI, 
they won't address the problem, i.e. *they won't report it*. This occurs all while we leave it to bureaucracy to wonder "are racism and sexism really a problem anymore if violations have a low number of complaints to the DOE or a low 
likelihood of a lawsuit to UCLA?" To put it plainly, misconduct has to be "very serious" to get anyone's attention. 

Now we see antisemitism shining a light on Title VI. While it has the spotlight, we should address the issue of discrimination on the basis of race and gender as well. Because if in either the case of antisemitism or discrimination 
based on race and gender you're dealing with a high volume of "less serious" cases of misconduct that deny equal access to an education, *that is very serious*. The world is changing incredibly quickly, it's hard for policy to keep up, 
and women and minorities are following the same pattern of delayed access that existed in the 70's but in areas like STEM. [figure](##fig:ucues-ucla-all-2022) and [figure](##fig:ucues-ucla-both-2022) compare the academic experience of students 
from 2022 in "all majors" versus certain "STEM majors". Looking at UCLA data qualitatively, we see that in [figure](##fig:ucues-ucla-both-2022) students who "somewhat disagree", "disagree", and strongly "disagree" with "feeling comfortable with 
the climate for diversity and inclusiveness" is 7% universitywide versus 21% in their major. [figure](##fig:ucues-uc-both-2022) shows a systemwide result of 11% versus 21%, respectively. UCUES seemingly
looks for an "agree" rating of 80% or more, so these statistics may go unnoticed. It would offer more clarity on the matter if we could look at race and gender demographics for STEM majors and the STEM
survey and what the breakdown is between the "agree" and "disagree" categories. This would help determine if the survey accurately represents the university as a whole, and whether the "disagree" categories make up a small or large portion 
of minorities within STEM majors. I.e. if certain STEM majors are 20% minority, and 20% "disagree", then efforts geared at Title IX and VI access have accomplished nothing. 

"Why was Title IX needed when it passed in 1972? Didn’t the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ban discrimination in several areas based on sex?"

"Women faced blatant educational inequality, such as exclusion from certain colleges and universities or from certain programs and spaces within those schools, higher admissions standards than men, more frequent tenure denials than men, 
and myriad other imposed disadvantages relative to men."[^203]

Title IX looked at male dominated fields and imposed certain mandates to increase female membership. It was not, however, about blindly meeting quotas to fast track women to equal outcomes. Minority membership needs more resources for 
background education. But equal opportunity means more than that; it means "soft skills" and "professionalism". If people in certain majors are made to feel "uncomfortable", 
perhaps there are more paths than those to the classroom during a protest that are being blocked.

The truth of the matter is, we would assume any workplace without an "HR department" would eventually be a cesspool of toxic behavior. It is astounding to me that academia has lasted so long without succumbing to the same disciplinary and 
oversight infrastructure that private industry is forced to maintain. Maybe it's because students are young or way too busy, but I guarantee every student would want an HR department. It would be a huge quality of life boost for everyone at this university. 

Effectively, that means everyone needs Title VI training, everyone: undergraduates, graduate students, professors, and administrators. Aspects of Title IX training should also change and oversight from the DOE should be far more engaged. We 
also know unless Title VI training is mandatory like Title IX, no university will implement a good enough system.

What Congressman Courtney said in the House Hearing on Education and the Workforce, [figure](##fig:congressional-hearing) @ 51:50, is vitally important to the well being of Jewish students, Muslim students and other minorities alike 
and it's worth watching his segment in its entirety. Basically, he states that in 2023 there were a record number of complaints made to the DOE Civil Rights Division, the number has tripled since 2009. Yet in 2009 the Civil Rights Division
was running a larger office than today. The proposal from the majority budget appropriations committee was also looking to cut the division's budget, up to 25%, essentially defunding the Civil Rights Office. He makes his concerns clear stating 
they should "beef up the ranks" of the department. Interestingly though, the DOE does have ample resources it can appropriate through protected channels,

"Six centers that are part of the UCLA International Institute have been awarded about $8 million in federal Title VI funding by the U.S. Department of Education.

With this funding UCLA will be able to offer education on world regions, provide tuition support and living stipends to students pursuing area studies and language training, and provide academic and pedagogical 
support for the teaching of languages."[^300] 

UCLA International Institute is deserving of this funding, I'm not denying that and and I'm aware that grant awards are non-fungible. However, I, along with Congressman Courtney am calling for a 
greater appropriation of funds to the Civil Rights Office. Because equal opportunity and access to an education are "basic" student needs, and continued budget cuts 
for an increasingly necessary office will not stop Title VI misconduct from ocurring and it certainly won't improve the wellbeing of postsecondary students across this nation.
