“[Title VI][^32] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title VI states that:

No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” [^33]

The “Education and Title VI” page of the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights goes on to use vague language with respect to monitoring and compliance activity, but displays instead a series of “Dear Colleague” letters offering guidance on a 
range of topics. The most recent one, dated May 25, 2023 states: 

“As we witness a nationwide rise in reports of antisemitic harassment, including in schools, I write to remind you of schools’ legal obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) 
to provide all students, including Jewish students, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics.

Earlier this year, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a fact sheet - Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics - explaining how the protection offered by Title VI, which prohibits 
discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by programs or activities of recipients of federal financial assistance, extends to students who experience discrimination, including harassment, based on their actual or perceived: (i) shared ancestry or 
ethnic characteristics; or (ii) citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity. 

Title VI protects all students, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. For example, OCR may investigate complaints that students have been subjected to ethnic or ancestral slurs; 
harassed for how they look, dress, or speak in ways linked to ethnicity or ancestry (e.g., skin color, religious attire, language spoken); or stereotyped based on perceived shared ancestral or ethnic characteristics. 

Schools must take immediate and appropriate action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile environment. OCR generally finds that a hostile environment exists where there is harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent 
so as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.

If a hostile environment based on shared ancestry existed, and the school knew or should have known of the hostile environment, OCR will evaluate whether the school met its obligation under Title VI to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to 
end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent harassment from recurring. In other words, a school violates Title VI when it fails to take adequate steps to address discriminatory harassment, such as antisemitic harassment.” 

Basically, the letter is defining harassment, stating that schools should take it upon themselves to sufficiently stop it, and if they don’t, “OCR will evaluate whether the school met its obligation under Title VI”. Looking at “Protecting Students from 
Discrimination based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics” ([Figure 1](#fig:doe-ocr-pamphlet)) the document runs through stereotypical racist tropes, finally offering a couple obvious, specific examples and how to file a complaint. It seems the oversight for Title VI rests mainly 
on suggestions and a complaint box. So, the above letter was written in May of 2023, in December of 2023 “The United States Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced an investigation Monday into antisemitic and Islamophobic activities on UCLA’s campus. 
The investigation is part of a broader Title VI inquiry announced by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in November, investigating universities and K-12 schools for discrimination based on “shared ancestry,” which is harassment based on someone’s ancestry or ethnic
characteristics.” [^34]

Now it is May, 2024 and “The U.S. Department of Education was asked to investigate Thursday whether civil rights were violated at UCLA where hundreds were arrested following several days of protest by pro-Palestinian and counter demonstrators. 
Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur, a Democrat, sought an “immediate” probe to examine whether Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was violated at UCLA, especially when it comes to protecting Jewish students from physical and verbal violence.” [^35] What happened to the 
first probe? What can really change if both OCR and post-secondary oversight infrastructure rely on “post-assault” measures, so to speak?  

Taking from my own experience, I can see the website for Graduate Title IX compliance uses words like “mandatory” and “obligated under law and policy…” [^36]. Where is the prevention education with respect to Title VI? Even if UCLA were adequately reprimanded, and 
investigated the incidents of harassment and assault thoroughly, without policy change from above, very little may change. 

Taking for example, the most recent public accountability reports from UCLA, between July of 2020 and June of 2021 there were 1,363 reports of prohibited conduct reported to the Title IX office. Over the same time period, there were 255 reports of prohibited conduct 
to the DPO. That is a significantly lower number, which could very well be due to falsely equating the circumstances surrounding such reports. Or would it be so far-fetched to assume that these 255 allegations were “extreme”, due to a complete lack of understanding of 
the Title VI code of conduct? I.e. just the obvious cases were reported. ([Fig. 2](#fig:dpo-investigations-title-vi)) ([Fig. 3](#fig:dpo-investigations-title-ix))

The training received through Title IX is very helpful in its “preventative measures”, but it’s also very helpful in teaching *every* student what their resources are, what their rights are, what is and is not okay, and who to report to. If students are left confused 
about what even happened to them, let alone who to report to, how will the complaints be filed? I take issue with the fact that, at the end of the day there’s a conflict of interest. The school, any school, would rather not be faced with the grievances of potentially 
litigious students well educated on what their rights are. I even find that I only have a clear picture of where my Title IX support is now after doing this research. 

The bottom line is, OCR seeks to prevent repeated, pervasive, prohibited conduct. It is obvious from the weeklong protest events we could likely amass 255 Title VI complaints, and given the political climate on campus many more if including the months before. But you 
can only stop something from repeating and becoming pervasive if you nip it in the bud. Which means students must be adequately trained in proper Title VI code of conduct. 

This is especially important now, given the rise in antisemitic and anti-Muslim and anti-Arab incidents nationwide since 2016 and more recently the events of Oct 7th [^37]. But given how the pandemic and social media have affected rates of anxiety and depression in young adults, 
it would be fair to say that everyone would benefit from Title VI support and education[^38]. This is especially true of students who are underrepresented at the university [^39].
