The Jewish position on the conflict among students ranges. Jewish organizations with the largest presence at UCLA are Hillel[^52] and Chabad House[^53]. Other organizations exist and most likely align with Hillel and Chabad’s overall message[^54].
One org that breaks from the others is Jewish Voice for Peace at UCLA. As shown in [Figure 16](##fig:jvp-ucla-official), the org states “Jewish Voice for Peace at UCLA is an inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, and community 
members at the University of California, Los Angeles who organize for a just and lasting peace in historic Palestine and build strong, resilient Jewish community beyond Zionism.”[^55]

[Figure 17](##fig:jvp-insta-wrestling-zionism) is an early messaging post from 2022. It is clear from both figures that “Zionism” also exists within the lexicon of JVP. Their definition likely refers to Jewish settlements, 
but as can be seen from the largely blank UCLA webpage, they don’t define the word.

Like the pro-Palestinian posts, the demonstration shown above on JVP’s Instagram profile is also insensitive in its timing. [Figure 18](##fig:jvp-insta-westwood-protest) shows their call for “Palestinian liberation” and a stop to the 
“genocide of Palestinians”. Their Instagram content, where they have been tagged by SJP (and FJP the faculty branch at UCLA) and vice versa ([Figure 19](##fig:jvp-insta-genocide)), shows that JVP stands in solidarity with SJP in opposing 
“Palestinian genocide” and supporting a “free Palestine”; they also support the boycott, divestment, sanctions movement[^56]. 

There seems to be a divergence in rhetoric between SJP and JVP, however, when it comes to the definition of a “free Palestine”. To reiterate, SJP promotes the phrasing “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free”. JVP takes what looks
like a settlement “anti-expansionist” into “historic Palestine” position. The author’s understanding can’t be verified explicitly, I can only define the message of any of these student organizations via the vague text within their social media
posts. It is important to also note that despite this divergence, SJP’s protest demands are largely “tenable”, so the two groups have managed to work together towards a common goal. CAC on the other hand, has not shown any evidence of working 
with JVP.   


Hillel and Chabad House are largely apolitical. Their related messaging centers around the Jewish experience (largely made up of grievances and discomfort) on campus after the events of Oct 7th. [Figure 20](##fig:chabad-pro-israel) shows a single
post on the Chabad House Instagram in support of the pro-Israel demonstrations that occurred at UCLA counter to the pro-Palestinian protests, but the weekend before the protests turned violent.
