Universities have long been a place where freedom of expression is welcome. When this expression comes in the form of civil disobedience, we typically see a 
marginalized group calling into question the doings or policies of an oppressive power structure. Today we're witnessing the largest protest movement on college campuses since
the Vietnam War. Historically, protest means "lawful messiness" and "clean conflict"---taking a stand against the Vietnam War or in favor of civil rights meant doing so unilaterally against a singular power. 
What we're observing now though isnâ€™t as simple. The protests mirror the complexities that exist in the Middle Eastern region itself, the issues are delicate and 
emotionally charged. As Americans many of its problems are not within our power to solve and yet our many diasporas entrenches us within them.  

The Daily Bruin[^400] was an excellent resource for me in keeping me informed on the day-to-day as the protests were happening. Reading the articles, I wanted more insight into what was going on and some of the issues that were new to me. 
Everyone else was caught up was watching the livestreams as the helicopters hovered overhead, loud and annoying enough to interrupt meetings. But I found myself gravitating to other sources of information, maybe the material was equally 
"raw" but in a different way. I began by reading people's Reddit posts (and being appalled by what was being discussed). After I adjusted somewhat to the nature of the content, I noticed these conversations were mirroring a lot of 
the "identities" associated with the pro-Palesinian movement and the campus climate that was becoming a product of it. I sought to further understand who it was bearing these identities and why. Not in a conventional "second hand way", but by
reading the words directly from the individuals driving the movement and directly from those otherwise involved, by choice or by circumstance.  

What is OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Journalism?
"Traditional breaking news can often be done with boots on the ground. The reporters are present in the conflict and see what is unfolding themselves. OSINT analysts on the other hand are often remote and are starting with digital 
materials arriving from diverse sources in different forms, formats, quality and relevance."[^91]

"OSINT is not a replacement for traditional journalism. It is a capacity built out of a set of analysis capabilities that provide more robust answers and pathways to answers to the very questions journalists and the public often ask: what happened, 
who did it, when, where, why, how and so forth. OSINT-developed conclusions or rebuttals are often newsworthy and hence become timely and relevant for the news."[^91]

I've been aggregating "data" from open source materials like the Daily Bruin, Instagram, Twitter and a few articles here and there since the Daily Bruin began writing on the protests. It's not exactly OSINT journalism but I was inspired by the 
idea. As a graduate student at UCLA and "hard-learned" engineer, we do nothing without ample data. Data gives a fuller picture for better insight, it is based on first-principles as a way to unify analysis, and it is shareable so that we may
assist in advancing knowledge.   

This project was a *massive* endeavor in data aggregation as my gift to the conversation, in hopes of learning from these events and making things better in the future. 
This is also a *first* endeavor in policy analysis that got somewhat muddled up with my opinions throughout. As a UCLA student I felt somewhat personally involved---I struggled in keeping my emotions from guiding me. 
The next project will consist of breaking this post apart; distilling policy and the broader issues from the areas where I recount events and assert my opinion.  

If you use this post or any other blog post on my website for your own projects, all that I ask is that you please cite my work. 

As a side note, the website is still in beta and I haven't worked all the bugs out yet. Things aren't working perfectly, some links may take an extra click here and there. I also just noticed the very slow page load, when I serve
the page locally I don't run into that issue. I'll have to compress some media and/or optimize some code. Apologies in advance!
