University campuses have long been a place where freedom of expression and civil disobedience are welcome. Themes that emerge are mainly that of a 
marginalized group calling into question the doings or policies of an oppressive power structure. Today we are seeing the largest protest movement on college campuses since
the Vietnam War. Civil disobedience assumes "lawful messiness" and "clean conflict"---protesting against the Vietnam War or in favor of civil rights meant standing unilaterally against a singular power.  Today the situation
isn’t as simple. The protests mirror the complexities that exist in the region itself, the issues are delicate and 
emotionally charged. As Americans many of its problems are not within our power to solve and yet our many diasporas entrenches us within them.  

What is OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Journalism?
"Traditional breaking news can often be done with boots on the ground. The reporters are present in the conflict and see what is unfolding themselves. OSINT analysts on the other hand are often remote and are starting with digital 
materials arriving from diverse sources in different forms, formats, quality and relevance."[^91]

"OSINT is not a replacement for traditional journalism. It is a capacity built out of a set of analysis capabilities that provide more robust answers and pathways to answers to the very questions journalists and the public often ask: what happened, 
who did it, when, where, why, how and so forth. OSINT-developed conclusions or rebuttals are often newsworthy and hence become timely and relevant for the news."[^91]

Data aggregation in order to formulate policy recommendations. 

The author chose to use Reddit r/UCLA as a resource in order to get a perspective directly from students.[^90] r/UCLA is “A community for UCLA students, faculty, alumni, and fans”[^89]. It is important to note that r/UCLA is an open community, 
which means that anyone on Reddit can read/write messages within the community. While it is likely, it is not guaranteed that statements made by any of the posts were made by current UCLA students. I chose to incorporate several posts as part 
of a contextual “thread” in each image which gives greater insight into the broader conversation and related issues student’s are concerned with. 

This project was a *massive* endeavor in data aggregation as my gift to the conversation, in hopes of gaining insight into this whole issue and making things better in the future. 
This is also a *first* endeavor in policy analysis that got somewhat muddled up with my opinions throughout. Like anyone personally involved events like these, I struggled in keeping my emotions from guiding me. The next project will consist of 
breaking this post apart; distilling policy and broader issues from the recounting of events, and my assertion of opinion.
