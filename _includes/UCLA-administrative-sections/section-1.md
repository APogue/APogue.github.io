When the pro-Palestinian protests---that ultimately led to violence that made national headlines---were happening at UCLA, other students were mostly caught up watching livestreams 
as helicopters hovered overhead, loud enough to interrupt meetings. I, on the other hand, happened upon a [Daily Bruin article](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment), 


“Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and 
Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. 
“I feel very uncomfortable,” he said. “I might skip my classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on campus."


Surprised by what was going on, I sought other sources of information that were “raw” like the livestreams, but in a different way. Sifting through [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/) I noticed conversations that
gladly took ownership of certain “identities” associated with the pro-Palesinian movement and the campus climate that was becoming a product of it. To further understand who 
bore these identities and why, I read Instagram (IG) posts directly from the individuals driving the movement and those otherwise involved (by choice or by circumstance). Here I discovered voices from all sides of the issue, and distilling 
the alarming elements---those contributing to the bullying, harrassment, or civil rights infringements of other students as well as those who were victims of it. 


Why have these voices been allowed to continue for so long unchecked and unnoticed? Through the aggregation of “data” from Twitter, UCLA webpages, 
and other open source materials I found that administrative apathy, or perhaps complacency or even "negligence" together with student misconduct have become what I believe is the lifeblood of civil rights infringements and 
dangerous incidents that continue to occur at UCLA. 


 


## Radical activity following Oct 7th was a warning sign






One organization in particular, the UCLA Cultural Affairs Commission<a href="https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/623" style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;(CAC), </a> has shown strong
support for the pro-Palestinian movement. The org's messaging on their UCLA hosted webpage is shown in the image below. As one of the first Undergraduate Student Association Council (USAC) 
organizations founded at UCLA, the CAC has been active for more than 50 years with support from tuition paid by every student.

In 2018 the serving commissioner<a href="https://femmagazine.com/cultural-affairs-commission-year-in-review/" style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;observed</a> a
&ldquo;problematic culture that exists at the University, which inadvertently oppresses [marginalized] individuals on the basis of race, gender, religion, etc.&rdquo; These views 
indicate a level of distrust in UCLA's ability to maintain an inclusive and fair environment on campus. Whether this distrust escalated into creating a potentially toxic culture within the org 
itself, and for how long, is unknown.

On October 9th, 2023 CAC posted the above message on its Instagram (IG) profile. 
The political message clearly shows the CAC's position on the events of Oct 7th. 
Considering timing, and with mention of &ldquo;Palestinians on the frontlines&rdquo; and &ldquo;From the River to The Sea, Palestine Will Be Free&rdquo; the post indicates they are siding with Hamas; implying the 
Hamas-led attacks on civilians were necessary to &ldquo;liberate from Isreal.&rdquo; While First Amendment rights protect these views, 
the post calls into question the use of student tuition funds to support this messaging.

## Antisemitic incidents at the protest were going "unnoticed"  

Even more troubling is the showcasing of Nazi insignia in an IG post dated April 25th (below). 
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-removes-trump-campaign-ads-nazi-concentration-camp-symbol/" 
style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;A Trump ad </a>was removed by Facebook for using the same imagery—
&ldquo;The social media company said the ads violated its policies against &ldquo;organized hate.&rdquo;&rdquo; While at face value the red triangle references 
a Nazi concentration camp <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/classification-system-in-nazi-concentration-camps" 
style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">political prisoner</a>, the true meaning for the triangle is unknown.
Alluding to any targeted group for Nazi hate but colored red in reference to the Palestinian flag; the intention may be hate 'in the name of' Palestine so to speak.

The above image (left) shows the full name of the USAC organization tent at the pro-Palestine encampment site (IG post dated 4/25). The

who is running for reelection, was in attendance and did not respond to requests for comment…It is unclear if funds from USAC offices are being used to fund resources at the demonstration, but the 
text “PAID FOR BY USAC” is visible on the Cultural Affairs Commission tent.”

The IG post below, dated 5/16, shows a more recent CAC post again displaying the triangle.

## Administration went into damage control mode




## A lot of talk and no action...

In response to UCLA's handling of the protest events, the CAC posted again, this time with the below image affixing the UCLA Chancellor (who is Jewish) Gene Block’s face to the body of a pig wearing a 
police uniform. The outlandish/unapologetic imagery, in keeping with CAC rhetoric, combines antisemitic stereotypes with derogatory slang for police officers.

Based on their USAC affiliation, CAC should not have any content on public facing sites they aren’t willing to post on their UCLA hosted site. Their 
content directly contradicts their mission *to be accessible to all students*.




## Could the UC System be hiding the *real problem*?
