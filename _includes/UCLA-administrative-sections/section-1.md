When the pro-Palestinian protests became so violent at UCLA they were making [national headlines](https://x.com/loisbeckett/status/1785843179801153865), students stayed informed by watching the livestreams
coming from helicopters hovering overhead, annoying and loud enough to interrupt meetings. I, on the other hand, decided on the [Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com) for
my news which turned out to be much more than just a good "ear to the ground" from a school paper---a team of reporters were working tirelessly to provide detailed, 24/7 coverage as events unfolded. As I followed their stories, it wasn't long before some of the
[reports](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment) began to concern me, 

"Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and
Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic.
'I feel very uncomfortable,' he said. 'I might skip my classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on campus.'"

With continued interest, I sought other sources that were "raw" like the livestreams, but offered more context in an attempt to find unfiltered truths. Sifting through [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/) I noticed conversations that
gladly took ownership of certain "identities" associated with the pro-Palestinian movement and the campus climate that was becoming a product of it. To further understand who
bore these identities and why, I read Instagram (IG) posts directly from the individuals driving the movement and those otherwise involved (by choice or by circumstance). Here I discovered voices from all sides of the issue, and distilling
the alarming elements---those contributing to the bullying, harassment, or civil rights infringements of other students as well as those who were victims of it.


Why have these voices been allowed to continue for so long unchecked and unnoticed? Through aggregate "data" from Twitter, UCLA webpages,
and other open source materials I found that administrative apathy---or perhaps complacency or even "negligence"---together with student misconduct have become,
in my opinion, the lifeblood of civil rights infringements and dangerous incidents that continue to occur at UCLA.


## Organizational messaging following Oct 7th was a warning sign
The main organizational contributors to the pro-Palestinian movement at UCLA are Students for Justice in Palestine ([SJP](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/90) 
at UCLA), the [UC Divest Coalition](https://www.instagram.com/ucladivest/), Jewish Voices for Peace ([JVP](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/3992)), and the Cultural Affairs Commission
 <a href="https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/623" style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">(CAC)</a>.
 
### The Cultural Affairs Commission is tuition funded
The Cultural Affairs Commission in particular has shown questionable behavior in their support for the pro-Palestinian movement. The org's messaging on their UCLA hosted webpage is shown in the image below. 
As one of the first Undergraduate Student Association Council (USAC) organizations founded at UCLA, the CAC has been active for more than 50 years with support from tuition paid by every student.

In 2018 the serving commissioner<a href="https://femmagazine.com/cultural-affairs-commission-year-in-review/" style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;observed</a> a
&ldquo;problematic culture that exists at the University, which inadvertently oppresses [marginalized] individuals on the basis of race, gender, religion, etc.&rdquo; These views 
indicate a level of distrust in UCLA's ability to maintain an inclusive and fair environment on campus. Whether this distrust escalated into creating a potentially toxic culture within the org 
itself, and for how long, is unknown.

On October 9th, 2023 CAC posted the above message on its IG profile. 
The political message clearly shows the CAC's position on the events of Oct 7th. 
Considering timing, and with mention of &ldquo;Palestinians on the frontlines&rdquo; and &ldquo;From the River to The Sea, Palestine Will Be Free&rdquo; the post indicates they are siding with Hamas; implying the 
Hamas-led attacks on civilians were necessary to &ldquo;liberate from Isreal.&rdquo; While First Amendment rights protect these views, 
the post calls into question the use of student tuition funds to support this messaging.

### Students for Justice in Palestine harbor "extreme" political views
SJP's [first post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMXtjEy11s/?hl=en) after the events of Oct 7th, dated Oct 9th, announces a teach-in held by two professors to offer 
"more clarity, information, and perspectives on recent escalations in Palestine."

On Oct 9th UCLA Chancellor Gene Block shared a [letter](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/university-statements-on-violent-attacks-abroad/) 
regarding the attacks on Oct 7th, posted there is also a letter from the UC Regents. Block also posted a [follow-up letter](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/reflections-at-the-close-of-a-difficult-week/)
 on Oct 13th. 

The below are posts from the UC-wide SJP organization in response to the UC Regents, dated Oct 17th, regarding rhetoric surrounding the Gaza conflict. In their message 
SJP stays focused on the victimhood of an occupied Palestine and the danger to students of a UC rhetoric that does not recognize the conflict from the Palestinian viewpoint. Here they write what will eventually become 
the protest demands for the pro-Palestinian movement at UCLA.

In contrast, the below reddit post taken from IG, dated Oct 19th, is more "extreme." Rather than focus on Palestinians as unrecognized victims, it asserts 
that the Chancellor conflated acts of resistance with acts of "terrorism." The alleged SJP post (it does not appear on their profile and could have been deleted) is also shown 
referring to the events of Oct 7th as the “Al-Aqsa” flood.

In contrast to CAC, SJP is a non-USAC affiliated Palestinian political organization and their activity is protected by the First Ammendment. Their activity becomes 
questionable when they use their propoganda system to repeatedly subject other members of the UCLA community to phrases such as "Palestine will one day be free, from the river to the sea," etc. 

### Jewish Voices for Peace take an "anti-Zionist" position
On their UCLA webpage, JVP [states](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/3992) that they 
“organize for a just and lasting peace in historic Palestine and build strong, resilient Jewish community beyond Zionism.”

The above post aligns with their overall [messaging](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjGe_BWPLYQ/?hl=en&img_index=1) regarding a "free Palestine."


There seems to be a divergence in rhetoric between SJP and JVP when it comes to the definition of a “free Palestine.” 
To reiterate, SJP promotes the phrasing “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free.” JVP takes what looks like a settlement 
“anti-expansionist” into “historic Palestine” position (cannot be explicitly confirmed). 

### Hillel and Chabad House support the Jewish and Israeli student community
Jewish organizations with the largest presence at UCLA are [Hillel at UCLA](https://www.uclahillel.org/about) and [Chabad House at UCLA](https://www.chabaducla.com/).

### How do these main players "interact?"
CAC tags SJP when they incorporate antisemitic imagery into their posts (more on this later). Because SJP allows CAC to tag 
them, they are partially responsible and should be recognized as sharing these views. 

Even if CAC were to stop their antisemitic activity, if SJP sides with Hamas and 
views a civilian massacre as an "Al-Aqsa flood," this violates the mandated CAC mission of inclusivity based on the student tuition funding they receive. 
Even phrasing such as "From the River to the Sea..." used by both orgs violates ethics restrictions on CAC activity. Thus unless there is a change in rhetoric from 
SJP, there should be no collaborations between the groups.

In regards to non-USAC orgs such as JVP, despite differing views on a "free Palestine," their Instagram content, where they have been tagged by SJP (and FJP the faculty branch at UCLA) 
and vice versa, shows they stand in solidarity with SJP. They collaborate in [protest efforts](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6MHxXNx3Bb/?img_index=1) and also 
support the boycott, divestment, sanctions ([BDS](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxqfsNngaOj/?img_index=1)) movement.

CAC on the other hand, *has not shown any evidence* (via IG tagging or "@" mentions) of working with JVP, despite a shared interest in the pro-Palestinian movement. 

Hillel and Chabad House are largely apolitical. Their relevant messaging centers around the Jewish experience--- 
largely made up of grievances and discomfort---on campus after the events of Oct 7th.

## The administration didn't want to face the problem 
David Myers wrote an [op-ed](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/02/op-ed-antisemitic-imagery-at-uc-regents-meeting-protest-threatens-campus-discourse) entitled 
*Antisemitic imagery at UC Regents meeting protest threatens campus discourse* where he addressed the tense political climate at UCLA, “Since Oct. 7, 
our campus – like so many across the country – has been the site of intense and often tense discourse and action. The divide between those who support the cause 
of Palestinian liberation and those who support Israel’s right to exist has deepened more than at any point in my 32 years at UCLA, creating a seemingly unbridgeable 
gulf between the two sides.

It has also created, at various points in time, a sense of unsafety among many members of the university community, especially students. This too tracks larger national trends, 
according to a 2024 report that shows that 56% of Jewish university students polled after Oct. 7 felt in personal danger, and 52% of Muslim students felt in personal danger.”

### October
The Instagram post below is referring to the previously mentioned professor led [teach-in](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMXtjEy11s/?hl=en) occurring on Oct 11th. The video shows people, referred to as "Zionists" in the post,
waiting for attendees to harass and blockade them from entering a classroom. A video of the encounter can be found on the 5th page of the post. This behavior shows clear student misconduct
due to the intimidation tactics and discriminatory harassment taking place; especially with the use of language such as "terrorist" and preventing access to a classroom using physical aggression with racist intent.

There was no statement made by Chancellor Block in reference to the above incident. 
### November 
Myers depiction of this “unbridgeable gulf” has been corroborated by the Daily Bruin, where [one article](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/students-voice-worries-over-islamophobia-on-ucla-campus) 
titled *Students voice worries over Islamophobia on UCLA campus*, dated November 19th, details several concerning statements made by students.

“&lsquo;I’ve been spit in the face. I’ve been directly pushed. I’ve been called a terrorist on multiple occasions,' said Mohammad, a student who was granted partial anonymity for safety reasons. 'I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, I’m getting mean looks and people looking at me, just eyeing me down. I know they have the intention to make it some kind of form of harassment if they have a chance.'"


“A Palestinian student, who was granted anonymity for safety reasons, said they have heard numerous accounts of people yelling hateful comments at those wearing keffiyehs. While they said they have only heard accounts of 
physical violence perpetrated by non-students, they added that they have seen students spreading hate speech on campus about Arab students – such as calling them terrorists and Nazis and saying they deserve to be raped and killed.”

The article also makes reference to an IG message, presumably the message below, detailing harassment and a physical altercation that took place on the Nov 7th rally held in support of Israel (last slide in Dan Gold's message above).

[Another](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus), *Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus*, also dated Nov 19th, highlights language among the pro-Palestinian 
movement that some students feel is threatening. 

The article talks about a rally held on Nov 8th in support of Palestine, shown [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzZEC9RJFFi/?img_index=1) on SJP's IG page. 

An incident occurred at this rally and is detailed in a Los Angeles Magazine [article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students "went viral online Friday for screaming 'beat that fucking Jew' through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu." Actual footage has been provided by the [New York Post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-df8M_avjk&ab_channel=NewYorkPost) below.

Dan Gold was quoted in the article saying "students have been called Zionists on social media...[he also] said he believes rallies in support of Palestine have made Jewish students feel unsafe on campus. He added that he feels 
that chants such as 'Resistance is justified when people are occupied' and 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' are statements intended to intimidate others.”

"Bella Brannon, the student president of Hillel at UCLA, said she has seen a swastika carved into a tree on campus and experienced people making comments that perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes during meetings."


A student was quoted saying "he knows some Jewish students who have skipped classes because they were uncomfortable walking through these rallies."


[Gene Block's response](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) to incidents occurring on both Nov 7th and 8th can be found here.  


Hillel’s student president Bella Brannon stated (in the same Daily Bruin article) that, “while she appreciates that the administration has made statements in support of Jewish students, she feels there is more that it could do. 
She added that she has heard of instances of Jewish students not receiving responses to complaints they sent to the UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.”

### May

[greens3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ck66g9/disc_how_do_you_expect_jews_to_act_on_campus/) also mentions antisemitic acts such as 
"I.e swastikas on Jewish buildings, a Nazi truck playing Jewish blood libel on a loud speaker outside of Anderson this week, people chanting for a global intifada"

## Antisemitic behavior continued as the pro-Palestinian movement gained traction
Nazi insignia appeared everywhere in the first two days of the pro-Palestinian protests. 


in a poster by unknown perpetrators that was then showcased in a CAC IG post dated April 25th (below). 
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-removes-trump-campaign-ads-nazi-concentration-camp-symbol/" 
style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;A Trump ad </a>was removed by Facebook for using the same imagery—
&ldquo;The social media company said the ads violated its policies against &ldquo;organized hate.&rdquo;&rdquo; While at face value the red triangle references 
a Nazi concentration camp <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/classification-system-in-nazi-concentration-camps" 
style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">political prisoner</a>, the true meaning for the triangle is unknown.
Alluding to any targeted group for Nazi hate but colored red in reference to the Palestinian flag; the intention may be hate 'in the name of' Palestine so to speak.

## Student and faculty voices are identity-driven
"Dan Gold, executive director of Hillel at UCLA, [said](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus) students have been called Zionists on social media, 
and he feels that faculty members have tried to demonize the Jewish community by speaking on subjects outside of their academic fields during class."

## After the protests the administration went into damage control mode




## A lot of talk and no action...

In response to UCLA's handling of the protest events, the CAC posted again, this time with the below image affixing the UCLA Chancellor (who is Jewish) Gene Block’s face to the body of a pig wearing a 
police uniform. The outlandish/unapologetic imagery, in keeping with CAC rhetoric, combines antisemitic stereotypes with derogatory slang for police officers.

Based on their USAC affiliation, CAC should not have any content on public facing sites they aren’t willing to post on their UCLA hosted site. Their 
content directly contradicts their mission *to be accessible to all students*.

## Student ignorance is making things worse

“Seeing so many students not being able to conceptualize that what they’re saying is antisemitic and is wrong is tough,” Brannon said."
