<p>One organization in particular, the UCLA Cultural Affairs Commission<a href="https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/623" style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;(CAC), </a> has shown strong
support for the pro-Palestinian movement. The org's messaging on their UCLA hosted webpage is shown in the image below. As one of the first four Undergraduate Student Association Council (USAC) 
organizations founded at UCLA, the CAC has been active for more than 50 years with support from tuition paid by every student.<p>

<p>In 2018 the serving commissioner<a href="https://femmagazine.com/cultural-affairs-commission-year-in-review/" style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;observed</a> a
"problematic culture that exists at the University, which inadvertently oppresses [marginalized] individuals on the basis of race, gender, religion, etc." These views 
indicate a level of distrust in UCLA's ability to maintain an inclusive and fair environment on campus. Whether this distrust escalated into creating a potentially toxic culture within the org 
itself, and for how long, is unknown.<p>

<p>On October 9th, 2023 CAC posted the above message on its Instagram profile. 
The political message clearly shows the CAC's position on the events of Oct 7th. 
Considering timing, and with mention of "Palestinians on the frontlines" and "From the River to The Sea, Palestine Will Be Free" the post indicates they are siding with Hamas; implying the 
Hamas-led attacks on civilians were necessary to "liberate from Isreal." While First Amendment rights protects these views, 
the post calls into question the use of student tuition funds to support this messaging.<p>

<p>Even more troubling is the use of imagery that references a Nazi classification system taken from an IG post dated April 25th (images above). 
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-removes-trump-campaign-ads-nazi-concentration-camp-symbol/" 
style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">&nbsp;A Trump ad </a>was removed by Facebook for using the same imagery—
"The social media company said the ads violated its policies against 'organized hate.'" While at face value the red triangle references 
a Nazi concentration camp <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/classification-system-in-nazi-concentration-camps" 
style="color:#0F52BA; text-decoration:none">political prisoner</a>, the true meaning for the triangle is unknown. It 
could be alluding to any targeted group for Nazi hate, but is colored red in reference to the Palestinian flag; hate 'in the name of' Palestine so to speak.<p>

<p>The above image on the left shows the full name of the USAC organization tent at the pro-Palestine encampment site (IG post dated 4/25). The

text-decoration:none;">Daily Bruin </a>took note of CAC's presence at the protest, “Cultural Affairs Commissioner Alicia Verdugo, 
who is running for reelection, was in attendance and did not respond to requests for comment…It is unclear if funds from USAC offices are being used to fund resources at the demonstration, but the 
text “PAID FOR BY USAC” is visible on the Cultural Affairs Commission tent.”<p>

<p>The IG post below, dated 5/16, shows a more recent post 
again displaying the triangle.<p>

<p>In response to UCLA's handling of the protest events, the CAC posted again, this time with the above affixing the UCLA Chancellor (who is Jewish) Gene Block’s face to the body of a pig wearing a 
police uniform. The outlandish/unapologetic imagery, in keeping with CAC rhetoric, combines antisemitic stereotypes with derogatory slang for police officers.<p>

<p>Based on their USAC affiliation, CAC should not have any content on any of their public facing sites they aren't willing to post on their UCLA hosted site. Their 
content directly contradicts their mission *to be accessible to all students*. To the best of the author's knowledge, no other organization, USAC-affiliate or not, has any content displaying Nazi insignia or hateful imagery. 
Other groups are "tagged" by CAC as can be seen in a few of the above screenshots, which does mean the content is also displayed on their Instagram profiles.<p>
