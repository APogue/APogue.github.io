## Approach

- Pick the people or incidents that stand out in my mind

- Then comb through and fill in context from sources, visuals

## Message template

What concerns me is safety, free speech, and that policy was followed. This spans across all groups.

üîπ Message Template (adaptable for text, email, or DM)

Hey [Name],
I‚Äôm a UCLA grad working on a project documenting how students experienced protest and administrative responses over the past year. I‚Äôm not affiliated with any orgs, and I‚Äôm not here to endorse or oppose anyone‚ÄîI‚Äôm trying to understand what happened from the perspective of those who lived it.

I‚Äôd really value the chance to hear your reflections‚Äîin your own words. I‚Äôm especially interested in how language, identity, and protest interacted in ways that outsiders often miss.

If you‚Äôre open to talking (on or off the record), I‚Äôd be grateful. Even one conversation would help me make this work more grounded and honest.

## Information release 
 
- probably should sign one with the understanding that some may be used for research and others for their story

### To any student (after study completion)
I don't know why I'm so surprised by the muted response to some incidents that occurred or the lack of response from the university or the greater community, I myself was very surprised by some of the admin statements, or that a study may conclude bias is occurring at UCLA. I suppose my "unique" reaction could be dismissed as naivete, maybe I don't know "how the world works," but my opinion really doesn't matter. The opinion of the people directly affected by this administration matters. Do you believe, if bias is occurring at UCLA, that it should just be dismissed? And more importantly, if you knew this is how you or your peers would be treated, would you still have chosen to come to UCLA?


### To one side or the other

The community or certain stakeholders might expect certain rhetoric from the university, whether it's not a neutral approach to administrating, or goes beyond that can't be known for sure. It is possible though, outside of negligence, a certain focus on protecting some groups while condemning others is expected. Maybe the unwillingness to condemn non-affiliates is also expected. 

Do you believe the university is listening to you, the student, you the participant in the campus culture, when they conduct themselves this way? In other words, violence aside, assuming that was not intentional, but that partial treatment was, how do you feel about that? Would you really care if the university went out of its way to advocate for inclusivity for everyone, and condemn antisemitism and anti-Muslim behavior equally? If it isn't for you, who do you believe the university does it for? How does it make you feel as a student, that your voice isn't being heard?


### Sergio Olmos

LAPD reported that they did not have sufficient personnel on hand to intervene until 2:45 am on May 1st. Would you agree with this statement? 


### UCPD (Chief John Thomas)

1. ‚Äú‚ÄúAs altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. He could not recall exactly when that occurred, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff‚Äôs Department to secure their assistance.‚Äù

    Tracking Newsroom updates this sounds like April 30th?

2. The report from 21 solutions indicates that UCPD were made aware of the April 28th permit. 

    The LAPD report states that UCPD and mutual aid partners were able to clear clashing counter-protesters that day. Was deescalation possible due to more advanced notice? 


### SJP (Mohammed) 

- [UC Policy on prohibited conduct](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/1001004/Anti-Discrimination)

    ask about d. Other Inquiry 

### UCLA Faculty 

- Robin D.G. Kelley

- Myers 

- Graeir 


### People hurt or arrested in protests

- Catherine Washington 

- Thistle Boosinger


### Myers

- Based on these lawsuits, has antisemitism in the last year been different than other years? Has it been more prevalent? 


### Asil Yassine

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the arrests will lead to charges against me but the cases are still in limbo over my head,‚Äù Yassine said. ‚ÄúBut the degree issue will set back my license by at least six months.‚Äù---What does this mean, she was not conferred in June, 2024? In other words even if the degree is delayed, if she is retroactively conferred in June then her license shouldn't be delayed. 

What are the outcomes of the two arrests?
