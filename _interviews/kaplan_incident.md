### The Kaplan incident 

- collect all evidence dating back to the social media post

- find all Bruin references 

- All people potentially involved 

- The FOIA request, exactly what did you ask and what did you get back? 

- All internal material 


###  Saree Makdisi <makdisi@humnet.ucla.edu>

- Held the Kaplan teach-in and contacted UCLA admin over the harassment incident

- What was the outcome with Office of IDE? 

- What was the outcome of the police report

- (no follow up at least from the administration as to the outcome of the "investigation") this is the kind of accountability transparency that is totally necessary


### Questions

- Can she ID the anyone who was there? 

	- She mentioned seeing them at the vigil that took place later that evening

	- Were they wearing masks? 

	- Was the guy who held up his phone that said "enjoy tonight" one of them? 

		- It was clearly a coordinated attack, planned, premeditated
