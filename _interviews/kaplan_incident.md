### The Kaplan incident 

- collect all evidence dating back to the social media post

- find all Bruin references 

- All people potentially involved 

- The FOIA request, exactly what did you ask and what did you get back? 

- All internal material 


###  Saree Makdisi <makdisi@humnet.ucla.edu>

- Held the Kaplan teach-in and contacted UCLA admin over the harassment incident

- What was the outcome with Office of IDE? 

- What was the outcome of the police report

- (no follow up at least from the administration as to the outcome of the "investigation") this is the kind of accountability transparency that is totally necessary


### Questions

- Can she ID the anyone who was there? 

	- She mentioned seeing them at the vigil that took place later that evening

	- Were they wearing masks? 

	- Was the guy who held up his phone that said "enjoy tonight" one of them? 

		- It was clearly a coordinated attack, planned, premeditated 

- How would it feel to know that masked assailants who may have ID'd a student were now free to attend campus events and be on campus at any time

- Did you or others file incident reports? If so, where (Dean of Students, UCPD, Title VI, SOLE)?

- Were you ever contacted for follow-up? (to test whether admin actually investigated).

- Did you see any sanctions against the attackers? (ban from campus, police referral, anything).

- What did admin tell you about next steps? (often revealing of minimization).

- What was the effect on your participation in campus life? (links to hostile environment). 

- (“incident happened” → “admin knowledge + indifference”)


# 🎤 Interview Prompts for UCLA Protest/Harassment Incidents

### A. Establishing Context
1. *Can you walk me through what you experienced during the incident?*  
   (This opens the door without leading; let them set the scene.)

2. *Were the people who targeted you students, or did they seem to be outsiders?*  
   (This feeds into `actor_student` coding.)

---

### B. Reporting & Administrative Knowledge
3. *Did you or anyone you know file a report about what happened?*  
   - If yes: *Where did you file it?* (Dean of Students, Title VI office, UCPD, SOLE, etc.)  
   - *Did you keep a copy, or get a confirmation email?*  

4. *Did any administrator, staff, or police officer contact you afterward about your report?*  
   - If yes: *What did they say would happen next?*  

---

### C. Follow-up & Sanctions
5. *Were you ever told whether the university identified the people involved?*  
6. *Do you know if the university pursued charges, banned anyone from campus, or applied any kind of sanction?*  
7. *From your perspective, did it feel like the attackers “got away with it”?*  

---

### D. Student Perception of Admin Response
8. *What, if anything, did administrators say to you about safety after the incident?*  
9. *Did you feel protected by the security or UCPD presence that day?*  
10. *Did their response make you feel more safe, less safe, or about the same?*  

---

### E. Broader Impact
11. *Did this incident change how comfortable you felt being on campus or attending events afterward?*  
12. *Looking back, what would you have wanted UCLA to do differently in response?*  

California Public Records Act Request

To: UCLA Police Department, Records Unit

This is a request under the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 6250–6270).

I am requesting any incident reports, arrest reports, or related police records concerning the events of October 11, 2023 at Kaplan Hall, UCLA, when non-student individuals disrupted a planned teach-in.  

Please also provide the corresponding daily crime log entries for October 11–12, 2023.  

If portions of the records are exempt, please release any segregable information such as the report number, date, time, location, and nature of the incident.  

I understand you may need to redact details, but I’d like at least the report number, date, time, location, and description.

Thank you,

That’s almost certainly what happened — and it fits the pattern you’ve been sketching.  

---

### 1. EDI vs. UCPD handoff
- Student files **EDI/Title VI complaint** → those offices don’t have police powers.  
- Student also files **UCPD police report** → that moves into a law-enforcement lane.  
- UCLA admin can then *wash their hands* and say: *“It’s in UCPD’s jurisdiction, not ours.”*  

---

### 2. Why that’s deliberate indifference
- Under Title VI, the university still has an **independent duty** to address harassment that creates a hostile environment — regardless of whether police are involved.  
- Shuffling it into UCPD’s lap with no follow-up from EDI, Student Affairs, or central admin is not a “response,” it’s a deflection.  
- Especially damning since Kaplan wasn’t random crime; it was **targeted, identity-based harassment** connected to campus climate.  

---

### 3. What UCPD likely did
- Wrote up an **incident report** (with “unknown suspects” because they were masked).  
- Logged it as a **disturbance** or maybe “battery” if they acknowledged the slap.  
- Closed it with no follow-up (disposition = “inactive” or “suspended”).  
- That’s why you haven’t seen anything — because nothing meaningful was pursued.  

---

### 4. Why records still matter
If you get the UCPD report and it says exactly that — “incident occurred, suspects unidentified, case inactive” — you’ve just proven:  
- UCLA knew about it (**report exists**).  
- They **classified it as minor** (disturbance, not hate crime).  
- They **let it drop** (inactive).  

That *is* your evidence of indifference.  

---

✅ So yes, I agree with you: the most likely reality is UCLA let UCPD hold the bag, and UCPD did the bare minimum. But pulling the report/log forces them to put that in black and white.  


### 1. What the duty actually is
- Under **Title VI (and mirrored in EDI policy)**, the university’s duty is not just to “punish the actor.”  
- The duty is to take **prompt and effective steps** to end the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects once the school *knows or should know* of it.  
- That obligation exists **even if the perpetrator is unknown or off-campus.**  

---

### 2. What “preponderance” means here
- If by a **preponderance of evidence** it *did happen* (and here you’ve got the SAM report, witness accounts, student filing, etc.), then UCLA is on notice.  
- They don’t get to say: *“We couldn’t ID the masked guys, so case closed.”*  
- Instead, they’re obligated to address the **hostile environment** those actors created:  
  - Safety measures (security presence, access controls).  
  - Communication (acknowledging the incident, condemning the conduct).  
  - Supportive measures for the affected students.  

---

### 3. Sanctioning vs. doing nothing
- If the perpetrators are identified → **sanctions** (ban from campus, referral to DA).  
- If they’re not identified → UCLA still has a duty to act *institutionally.*  
- What they cannot do under Title VI is **shrug and let the report disappear.**  

---

### 4. What Kaplan shows
- Student filed report → perpetrators masked, probably no ID.  
- UCLA’s EDI/Student Affairs track: shifted to *“dialogue across differences.”*  --- this we don't know, that was simply a vice chancellor email chain that looped the head of the initiative in
- UCLA’s UCPD track: likely closed as *“unknown suspects.”*  
- The net result: **no institutional measures** to address the hostile climate.  

That’s the **deliberate indifference**: they equated *“we can’t ID the attackers”* with *“we have no obligations.”*  
But the law says their duty extends beyond sanctions — it’s about ensuring students aren’t left in an environment where they can be targeted again.  

### Title IX parallel
Under **Title IX**, even before a full investigation resolves “responsibility,” schools can impose **interim measures**:  
- separating complainant and respondent,  
- adjusting class schedules,  
- providing escorts or campus security,  
- offering counseling or housing changes.  

The key: those steps are **not “sanctions”** — they’re **remedies to address hostile environment.**  

---

### Title VI / EDI parallel
The same principle applies: once the school *knows or should know* about harassment, it has to **act to make campus safe.**  

Even if:  
- the perpetrator can’t be identified,  
- the evidence doesn’t rise to “clear and convincing,”  
- or police don’t pursue charges.  

UCLA still has to address the **effects**:  
- increase security,  
- communicate with targeted groups,  
- provide supportive resources.  

---

### Why Kaplan is so stark
- It wasn’t just an ambiguous incident — there’s a SAM report confirming outsiders slapped, threatened, and harassed students.  
- Even if masked perpetrators were never ID’d, UCLA had **more than enough basis** to:  
  - Treat outsiders as a standing threat,  
  - Take protective steps for pro-P students going forward,  
  - Publicly condemn the conduct and reassure the community.  

Instead, they collapsed it into *“dialogue across differences,”* which is **categorically insufficient under federal standards.**  


### The cleanest path: ask the student directly

If you can reach the student who:  
- filed the **EDI complaint**, and  
- said she filed a **police report**,  

then you can just ask:  
- *Did anyone from EDI or Title VI ever contact you about your report?*  
- *Did you receive a closure letter, outcome notice, or any follow-up?*  
- *Were any protective measures offered (security, no-contact, academic accommodations)?*  
- *From your perspective, did anything happen after you filed?*  

---

### Why this works
- If she says **“No, nothing ever happened”** → that’s extremely strong evidence of deliberate indifference.  
- If she says **“Yes, they followed up but only with a generic climate program”** → you’ve shown the gap between legal duty (Title VI remedies) and what UCLA delivered (dialogue).  
- If she says **“Yes, there was a formal process”** → then you’ve learned what UCLA withheld from your PRA request, which itself is important.
