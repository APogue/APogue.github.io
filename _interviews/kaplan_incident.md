###  Saree Makdisi <makdisi@humnet.ucla.edu>

- Held the Kaplan teach-in and contacted UCLA admin over the harassment incident

### Questions

- Can she ID the anyone who was there? 

	- She mentioned seeing them at the vigil that took place later that evening

	- Were they wearing masks? 

	- Was the guy who held up his phone that said "enjoy tonight" one of them? 

		- It was clearly a coordinated attack, planned, premeditated
