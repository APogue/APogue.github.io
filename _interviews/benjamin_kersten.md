## Benjamin Kersten 

- sukkah 

- the lawsuit testimony 

- his statements in the bruin about Jewish grief 

- his perspective on Zionism 

- his perspective on CAC

- his perspective on the JVP incident at UC Michigan 

- his perspective on some of the more extreme art (it is free speech i don't know if this question is appropriate)

### Questions

- Do you believe that CAC was exhibiting discriminatory behavior? 

- Do you know what the conditions were for access to the encampment, like when someone "vouched" for someone to enter? 

- Did JVP support encampment blockading, if so, why?

- How do you define Zionism? 

- Tell me about how this scenario was a heckler's veto

- Why was the blockading happening? Was it a purity test? Were people on campus during the day presenting a serious threat? or was it both? 

	- The reason I ask is because students like Eli Tsives did not present a threat to the encampment, but I can't quantify whether there was more barricading and exclusion as harassment increased (he may not answer these as litigation is ongoing, will have to find either anonymous or someone else)

	- Because the photo from the guy who said "get ready for tonight" looked like it was taken during the day

	- Because the horrible vitriol and harassment was happening during the day
