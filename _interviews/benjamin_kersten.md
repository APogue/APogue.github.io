## Benjamin Kersten 

- sukkah 

- the lawsuit testimony 

- his statements in the bruin about Jewish grief 

- his perspective on Zionism 

- his perspective on CAC

- his perspective on the JVP incident at UC Michigan 

- his perspective on some of the more extreme art (it is free speech i don't know if this question is appropriate)

### Questions

- Do you believe that CAC was exhibiting discriminatory behavior? 

- Do you know what the conditions were for access to the encampment, like when someone "vouched" for someone to enter? 

- Did JVP support encampment blockading, if so, why?

- How do you define Zionism? 

- Tell me about how this scenario was a heckler's veto

- Did UCLA respond to this Daily Bruin article that stated students would not leave the encampment after being told to do so? In the lawsuit, you said after the mob attack, Darnell Hunt came to the encampment to try to convince people to leave. That he feared the mob "would come back." Did they have a representative meet with the encampment to express this concern the day before?

	"UC Divest also said in its press release that it plans to remain in the encampment in spite of notice of disciplinary action from the campus administration. It added that it has been engaged in private negotiations with UCLA about meeting its demands.

	“We will not leave,” UC Divest said in the press release. “We will remain here until our demands are met.”"



- Why was the blockading happening? Was it a purity test? Were people on campus during the day presenting a serious threat? or was it both? 

	- The reason I ask is because students like Eli Tsives did not present a threat to the encampment, but I can't quantify whether there was more barricading and exclusion as harassment increased (he may not answer these as litigation is ongoing, will have to find either anonymous or someone else)

	- Because the photo from the guy who said "get ready for tonight" looked like it was taken during the day

	- Because the horrible vitriol and harassment was happening during the day
