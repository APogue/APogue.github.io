### Notes and context

- the point here is not to "interest farm"

- display the facts, with no judgement, e.g. you believe there was pervasive harassment going on, or that harassment was so severe it denied students access to their education (there was exclusion). So don't say that, present the facts. There was x, y, z, incidents, whether that crosses the line for pervasive is unknown, but when reports were submitted, she claimed there was no response from the school. Where is the line when it comes to direct notice and responsibility by the school to step in? 


“Bella Brannon, the student president of Hillel at UCLA, said she has seen a swastika carved into a tree on campus and experienced people making comments that perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes during meetings.”60

“Seeing so many students not being able to conceptualize that what they’re saying is antisemitic and is wrong is tough,” Brannon said (DB-001)


Hillel’s student president Bella Brannon stated in a Daily Bruin article dated November 19th that, “while she appreciates that the administration has made statements in support of Jewish students, she feels there is more that it could do. She added that she has heard of instances of Jewish students not receiving responses to complaints they sent to the UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.” (DB-001)


“We are seeing hate arise as a tragic ripple effect of the ongoing war between Isreal and Hamas, with Campus Administration failing to recognize and confront various reports of harassment submitted to the office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Additionally numerous council members within our student gov’t have publicized vitriolic remarks that continually harm Jewish students on our campus and exclude Jewish students from their inclusion efforts. Despite Hillel’s calls to cordially engage with these Student Gov’t members, our invitations have been repeatedly ignored.” (SOC-001)

- Some universities have explored incident-responsive restorative dialogue as a way to address harm and rebuild trust between student communities after tense or discriminatory events. Do you think that’s something you or your peers at Hillel would be open to participating in—when appropriate—or is there more comfort in addressing incidents within your own community or through parallel processes—like holding your own community discussions, working directly with administrators, or issuing statements separately—without engaging directly with groups on the other side of the conflict?

    Do you see potential value in cross-community conversations after major campus incidents, or is the priority right now more about internal safety and healing?

- [3rd party IG post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4yVx9crpDa/), knowing this was endorsed by SJP and UCLA Divest, did incidents like this cause fear among Jewish students (this feels like a leading question, based on my hypothesis)

- Was the petition to have Verdugo impeached acknowledged by anyone on campus

- Have USAC members ignored calls for diplomacy with Hillel? 

- [Fox News: UCLA students allege discrimination on campus](https://noticias.foxnews.com/video/6365452331112)

    - Has she or any other Jewish members of UCLA filed a Judicial Board petition before? Specifically referring to the [UCLA BIPAC message](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3a68r6uAHC/?igsh=ZWMyNDBlOTQyNg%3D%3D&img_index=3)

    - There was a recall petition, but did they go through any of the appropriate channels? 

    - She mentioned "the university doing nothing," had they submitted reports about CAC to the university before? 

- [USAC Cultural Affairs Commissioner faces allegation of antisemitic discrimination](https://dailybruin.com/2024/11/29/usac-cultural-affairs-commissioner-faces-allegation-of-antisemitic-discrimination)

    “I have every reason to believe, based on these numbers – as well as the quotes we have from Verdugo – that our perceived associations with Zionism were attached to our Jewish faith, and we were rejected,” Brannon said.

    "In the memorandum granting the petition, Venkatesh said the board will formally consider whether Verdugo violated Article I, Section E of the USA Bylaws, which prevents USAC from supporting or being affiliated with “any organization which legally discriminates on the basis of: race, creed, sex (except as exempt from Title IX), age, national origin, religion, physical handicap, or sexual orientation.”"
