	- "“As I approached him, the group of men came around and grabbed me, shoved me to the ground, and they were beating and kicking me for about a minute,” Buchanan said. “I wasn’t seriously injured at all: I just had bruised ribs and a couple of bruises on my face.”

		He noted that they sprayed him with a chemical irritant again while he was being beaten, and that his phone fell from his pocket in the course of the attack. When he attempted to retrieve it after the men had left, he found it in a nearby trash can, shattered. Buchanan said all of his protest footage from that night was lost."

	- "The counter-protesters also attempted to engage with Daily Bruin reporters at the scene by yelling at them and calling one a sexist slur through megaphones, as well as following and recording them."

	- Is this also Nouri? How does she know him? How did she recognize him? 

	- Why did she choose not to name him specifically? Is she unsure? She only named him to one outlet.

	- Daily Bruin news editor Catherine Hamilton, 21, **told The Times she recognized one of the counterprotesters as someone who had previously verbally harassed her and taken pictures of her press badge.** The individual instructed the group to encircle the student journalists, she said, **before they sprayed the four with Mace or pepper spray, flashed lights in their faces and chanted Hamilton’s name.**

		As she tried to break free, Hamilton said, she was punched repeatedly in the chest and upper abdomen; another student journalist was pushed to the ground and beaten and kicked for nearly a minute. The attack was first reported in the Daily Bruin.

	- "“We expected to be harassed by counterprotesters,” Hamilton said in an interview Wednesday, adding that every Daily Bruin reporter was instructed to use a buddy system, to report from outside the encampment and to leave the area if it became unsafe. “I truly did not expect to be directly assaulted.”"

		"The incident lasted about five minutes. The group of four made their way to the Daily Bruin newsroom before Hamilton went to the hospital, accompanied by her editor in chief, when the bruising made it difficult for her to stand and breathe. She has since been released."

- Potential paper trail from [Catherine Hamilton](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/03/28/scxj-m28.html)

	- "Catherine Hamilton, a journalist with UCLA’s student newspaper, the Daily Bruin, testified that UCLA Media Relations had promised all student journalists 24-hour access to Haines Hall for their safety due to ongoing threats of violence on campus.

	When seeking safety at Haines Hall during the May 1 Zionist mob attack, Hamilton was denied access by UCLA’s private security even after repeated attempts to contact UCLA Media Relations for over three hours. **This resulted in Hamilton being repeatedly beaten and maced by Nouri Mehdizadeh and a small mob under his command while UCLA’s private security watched.**

	**Hamilton claims she has been repeatedly threatened and even assaulted by Mehdizadeh since April 27, with UCLA officials ignoring Hamilton’s numerous reports of this abuse.**"

	- "As they walked past a line of cops and along a well-lit street in the center of campus, just before 3:30 am, she says they were encircled by a small group of counterprotesters mainly dressed in black. **She told CNN the man leading the group was someone whom she immediately recognized. He was a counterprotester who had previously verbally harassed her and taken a photo of her press badge, she said.**

		Within seconds, they sprayed the student journalists with a type of mace or pepper spray and flashed lights in their faces. As she tried to get away, Hamilton said, she was repeatedly struck in the chest and abdomen.

		One of the journalists confronted the attackers and shoved one before he was pummeled to the ground and beaten, according to **video footage of the incident.**"

	- Who has this footage, CNN? Does Catherine have footage?

- [Lawsuit #4](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OMNIBUS-COMPLAINT-final-2-1.pdf)

	- She names him in this civil complaint (not sworn)

	- If CNN and LATimes weren't willing to name him, her allegation doesn't meet their evidentiary standards
