### Building Tools for Institutional Accountability
A transparent framework for detecting bias in institutional oversight 

[Visual workflow diagram or sample incident analysis screenshot to convey value]

2.	Before/After Comparison:
	- Before: “Anecdotal complaints, years later”
	- After: “Systematic evidence, real-time”
3.	The Problem/Solution Visual:
    - Show chaos/unclear responses → organized/transparent analysis

## The Problem
- When protests happen on campus...
- How do we know if responses are fair?
- Current oversight relies on...
- [fourth bullet point]

## The Approach
[4 key innovations, maybe with icon fonts or emoji]
- 📊 Structured Evidence Collection: Every incident coded using 20+ variables
- 🔍 Source-Traceable Analysis: All claims linked to specific documents
- 🤖 AI-Assisted Consistency: Using Claude API to scale rigorous coding protocols
- 📂 Open Methodology: Replicable framework others can adapt
