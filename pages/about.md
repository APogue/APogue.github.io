**My Education**

Education: San Diego Mesa Community College 2008-2010 (Associate’s degrees), University of California San Diego 2010-2013 
(B.S. Chemical Engineering), University of California Los Angeles 2014 – 2024 (M.S. Mechanical Engineering 2016, Ph.D. Candidate 2018, Ph.D. conferred 2024).


**The Basics**

My writing is “homegrown” but I do use chatbots for formatting and some editing. 

I’m a “first principles” thinker; likely because I'm a product of simple values, (statistically) zero indoctrination, and a lot of listening before forming an opinion.  

**The Turning Point**

Engineering was really the turning point for me in critical thinking. I wasn’t a typical engineer growing up. The simple mechanisms I came 
across in everyday life were a mystery to me and I thought they'd remain that way. When I went to college I found I excelled in math and science,
subjects fundamental to robotics engineering. At one point I took a course in digital control that was hands-on and required me to implement theory on a robot I built myself. 
This was my first introduction to robotics but I was amazed by how much I could to do with so little background. After spending some time in a robotics lab, I decided to pursue robotics,
but it wasn’t smooth sailing from there. Certain principles in robotic design were still lost on me, mechanisms looked crude in form — the details 
and nuances of their purpose remained a mystery. I was frustrated but looked again and again, hoping to see beyond the surface. After some time, like a foreign language,
words that were just sounds began to have meaning. I started to understand them and the power they held when they came together. I learned to be observant, pay attention to detail, 
and that the simplest components can play incredibly important roles in the overall function of a mechanism. Looking back, robotics engineering allowed me to see the world in a way I never thought possible. It has given me incredible insight: 
“figurative glasses” to help me see just like my physical ones do.

**The Takeaway** 

My major field was called Systems and Controls. In essence it's about:

- Mapping how subsystems interact — modeling dependencies and interfaces so the whole system behaves predictably

- Theorizing input–output behavior — what signals go in, how the system transforms or reacts to those signals, and what signals come out

- Empirical testing — ensuring proper engagement with the environment under observation such that all inputs are correctly mapped to the proper outputs in practice

- Closing the loop — sensing deviations and ensuring feedback control mechanisms bring the system back within a range of desired behavior

In short: it's the discipline of understanding how complex systems behave — whether those systems function by the rules of physics or the law, and creating control algorithms — often called "policies" — for making them behave predictably, even under uncertainty. If the system deviates beyond a desired threshold due to a changing environment or disturbance such that it cannot maintain stability, the control policy is incomplete. 

**The Future**

<!--The transparency with respect to my background has the purpose of relating my unique value proposition and nothing more. In my life there are many things I’ve come across 
that I’ve been dissatisfied with, and others I may be apathetic or indifferent towards. It is with these unique perspectives that together we may serve as many people as possible. -->

I'm interested in data-driven policy. My research and publications will mainly focus on demonstrating how responsible data practices can help improve our world.

**My Interests**

I love comedy, spy thrillers, poetry, and basketball. Would also love to get into some DIY projects if I ever have time.
