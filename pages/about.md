**The Beginning**

<!--A would-be graduate of high school in 2001, but that didn’t happen (no high school diploma, no GED). Took some time to find myself. 
Ended up at San Diego Mesa Community College 2008-2010 (a bunch of Associate’s degrees), University of California San Diego 2010-2013 
(B.S. Chemical Engineering), University of California Los Angeles 2014 – present (M.S. Mechanical Engineering 2016, Ph.D. Candidate 2018).-->

**The Basics**

My writing is “homegrown” but I do use chatbots for formatting and some editing. 

I’m a “first principles” thinker; likely because I'm a product of simple values, zero indoctrination, and a lot of listening before forming an opinion.  

**The Turning Point**

Engineering was really the turning point for me in critical thinking. I wasn’t a typical engineer growing up. The simple mechanisms I came 
across in everyday life were a mystery to me and I thought they'd remain that way. I found in my college years that I excelled in math and science,
subjects fundamental to robotics engineering. At one point I took a course that was hands-on and required me to implement theory I’d learned on a robot I built myself. 
This was my first introduction to robotics. I was amazed by how much I was able to do with so little background. After spending some time in a robotics lab I decided to pursue robotics,
but it wasn’t smooth sailing from there. Certain principles in robotic design were still lost on me. Mechanisms I looked at were crude in form; the details 
and nuances of their purpose were a mystery. I was frustrated but looked over and over again, hoping to see beyond the surface. After some time, like a foreign language, 
words that were just sounds began to have meaning. I started to understand them and the power they held when they came together. I learned to be observant, pay attention to detail, 
and that the simplest components can play incredibly important roles in the overall function of a mechanism. Looking back, robotics engineering allowed me to see the world in a way I never thought possible. It has given me incredible insight: 
“figurative glasses” to help me see just like my physical ones do.

**The Future**

<!--The transparency with respect to my background has the purpose of relating my unique value proposition and nothing more. In my life there are many things I’ve come across 
that I’ve been dissatisfied with, and others I may be apathetic or indifferent towards. It is with these unique perspectives that together we may serve as many people as possible. -->

I'm interested in the intersection of policy and tech; specifically how AI will come to shape our world. My blog posts will mainly focus on topics surrounding these issues.

**My Interests**

I love comedy, poetry, and basketball. I'd love to get into some DIY projects if I ever have time...Does this website count? 😎
