Around 40 protesters staged a sit-in at UCLA’s Luskin Conference Center to oppose a UC Regents policy proposal that would bar university departments from making political statements. UCLA administrators cited Time, Place, and Manner violations, stating the protest lacked a permit. Protesters later regrouped in an area where they were permitted to assemble to continue demonstrations through the end of Regents’ meetings a couple days later, calling for UC divestment from BlackRock and opposing limits on academic free expression.
