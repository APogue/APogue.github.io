Article summary: 

On March 20, 2024, the UC Board of Regents unanimously voted to delay its decision on Item J1, a policy that would prohibit political statements on University department homepages, until its May meetings. The discussion began in a joint session of two regents committees. A sit-in protesting the policy began Tuesday night, with participants citing concerns over limitations on pro-Palestine speech. During the meeting, protesters interrupted with chants of ‚ÄúShame on you,‚Äù prompting regents to vacate the room. The meeting was moved to a closed session, and protesters were asked to leave under threat of arrest. The session later resumed with limited attendance. UC President Michael Drake and some regents expressed that the policy was not ready for a vote.
