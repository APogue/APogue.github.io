Incident: Counter-Protester Breach and Fight at Encampment (April 29–30, 2024)

(c) Campus safety failure documented: Around midnight, ~60 counter-protesters attempted to breach the pro-Palestine encampment in Dickson Plaza. A physical fight broke out, prompting UCPD in riot gear to intervene.

⚠️ Scope: Discrete nighttime confrontation involving violence, barricade fortification, and law enforcement presence; no arrests were made.

On the night of April 29–30, 2024, around 60 counter-protesters attempted to breach the pro-Palestine encampment in Dickson Plaza, leading to a fight between opposing groups around 11:40 p.m. UCPD officers in riot gear intervened to separate the groups before leaving the scene at about 12:15 a.m. Protesters inside the encampment used wooden planks to reinforce barricades, and CSC security created a barrier with their bikes. Earlier, UCPD responded to two individuals attempting to enter the encampment through nearby bushes; one fled and was chased, while the other was released. No arrests were made, and none of the involved groups responded to comment.
