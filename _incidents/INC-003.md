Around 40 protesters staged a sit-in at UCLAâ€™s Luskin Conference Center. Protesters entered the hotel building around 8 p.m.; by 8:40 p.m., UCPD requested LAPD backup. Hotel staff forcibly removed protesters shortly afterward. Police from multiple departments arrived in riot gear and set up barricades, prompting student concerns about excessive force. UCLA administrators cited violation of the school's Time, Place, and Manner policies---meant to prioritize student safety---as the reason for the removal and relocation of the protest.
