Incident: Luskin Sit-in and Police Mobilization (Tuesday night)

(b) Symbolic protest: Sit-in in the Luskin Conference Center lobby.

(c) TPM enforcement / campus safety response:

Protesters were forcibly removed by hotel staff.

UCPD called LAPD and Beverly Hills PD for backup.

Riot gear, rubber bullets, barricades deployed.

UCLA spokesperson confirmed permit violation and dispersal under TPM policy.

üìçScope: Physical location (lobby of Luskin), type of protest: sit-in, encampment. Clear moment of admin escalation and visible force deployment.

On March 19th, 2024 around 40 protesters staged a sit-in at UCLA‚Äôs Luskin Conference Center to oppose a UC Regents policy proposal that would bar university departments from making political statements on department websites. Protesters entered the hotel building around 8 p.m.; by 8:40 p.m., UCPD requested LAPD backup. Hotel staff forcibly removed protesters shortly afterward. Police from multiple departments arrived in riot gear and set up barricades, prompting student concerns about excessive force. UCLA administrators cited Time, Place, and Manner violations, stating the protest lacked a permit. Protesters later regrouped in an area where they were permitted to assemble to continue demonstrations through the end of Regents‚Äô meetings a couple days later, calling for UC divestment from BlackRock and opposing limits on academic free expression.
