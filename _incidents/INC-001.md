During a protest outside the UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA, a statue was placed in the free speech zone depicting a pig holding a bag of money and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, along with a Star of David emblem. The effigy drew backlash for invoking antisemitic tropes historically used to dehumanize Jewish people. The incident was widely condemned and covered in campus media, particularly for its emotional impact on Jewish students.
