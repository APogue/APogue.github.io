Incident: Pig Effigy Displayed at Regents Protest (March 20‚Äì21, 2024)

(a) Identity-based harm alleged: A statue depicting a pig holding a money bag and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, alongside a Star of David, was displayed near the Regents meeting. A UCLA Jewish history professor publicly described it as antisemitic.

(b) Symbolic protest present: The effigy appeared alongside signs and chants calling for divestment from companies linked to Israel, clearly forming part of the visual protest narrative.

üìçScope: Visual protest element interpreted as invoking antisemitic imagery at a Regents meeting event; prompted faculty-level public criticism.

During a protest outside the UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA, a statue was placed in the free speech zone depicting a pig holding a bag of money and a birdcage with a keffiyeh, along with a Star of David emblem. The effigy drew backlash for invoking antisemitic tropes historically used to dehumanize Jewish people. The incident was widely condemned and covered in campus media, particularly for its emotional impact on Jewish students.
