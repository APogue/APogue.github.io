### Wasteful wasteful spending on speech absent of deterrence rhetoric, ie the cost of these protests, the costs of policing peaceful students 

- Rick Braziel 

	- what is his actual role

	- tons of spending going in to complete tasks he was brought on for through independent contractors 

	- feels like installing him so quickly without due diligence process was damage control 

	- really just pointing the guns at students with answers of more, more, more security and police personnel for any event (polo shirts, hide people in buildings)

- tons of money is being spent on policing activity on campus rather than using deterrence rhetoric

- tons of money is being spent on policing peaceful students

- all the money spent on munitions is being used on students only, why?

## Consequences for students

It wasn't just the arrests that mattered. It was the sanctions imposed on students without due process. This connects the administration to the police conduct. The police were not acting alone, this was at the behest of the administration. 

This is also clear because two separate individuals, Hunt and Braziel mentioned a "smooth commencement," the arrests that took place on June 10th were a means to that end.
