- was the incident treated as organized or treated as an "instance"

- correlation between any incident harming any group and stated antisemitism in response

- correlation between any incident harming any group and stated anti-Muslim hate in response

- correlation between any incident harming any group and stated discrimination based on Israeli national origin in response

- correlation between any incident harming any group and stated discrimination based on Palestinian 


A simple back-and-forth like “Do you believe Israel should exist?” → “Yeah.” → “Okay.” → walk away = just a political conversation.

If someone uses that stance as a litmus test to exclude students from opportunities, groups, or services, that can fall under discrimination based on national origin (since it ties to Israel/Palestine as national identities).

Threatening violence, harassing, or stalking someone because they are perceived Muslim and in support of Gaza, if they were wearing hijabs, if they were selling hijabs then that is anti-Muslim bias. 

- [april 30 incident response](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/condemning-violence-in-our-community), visibility was high

    - how might you define "specific" in this scenario? was there a discrimination rhetoric gap?

    - OCR and civil rights law recognize that expressions of support for Palestine often overlap with protected identities (Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Middle Eastern, sometimes Jewish). If those individuals are attacked, it’s not “purely political” — it can also be bias-based harassment.

    - OCR guidance emphasizes that institutions should name potential bias when incidents affect protected groups. Without that, affected students can feel unseen or unprotected.

    - “We also recognize that this attack may have included elements of anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, or antisemitic bias, and we are committed to investigating any such discrimination fully.”

### Research question

- were communicated response measures associated with incident severity or visibility?

- when visibility was held constant, were there bias markers present in communicated response?

- when severity was held constant, did the school take specific measures to address the hostile environment or protected-class basis of conduct?

### Analytical Questions

- How were administrative responses correlated with **group identity, media visibility, and severity of incidents**?  
- Did UCLA consistenly address the **hostile environment** obligations under Title VI?
- Did failures to address hostile environment obligations lead to greater hostilities? E.g. did UCLA act when given constructive notice, did UCLA assess 

kaplan indicates premeditated and coordited threat potential (elevated threat)
kaplan indicates SAMS were not qualified to handle the situation
kaplan indicates threats could escalate to physical violence
kaplan indicates people pay attention to social media (take the views number as the baseline)
kaplan indicates the greater community is aware of what is going on (tons of death threats to the department caused them to move the meeting to zoom)
kaplan indicates that SAMS take true threats and violence as a free speech issue
internal emails indicate that the same incident was framed as a campus climate issue between students

Did UCLA leave the police report in the hands of the student?
If the masked perps were not identified, did UCLA publicly cite violations of the law or university policy or use language intended to threaten institutional preparedness for anyone planning to come to campus and harrass students? 
Did UCLA take any steps to try to alleviate a potential hostile environment for the students after the report was submitted?
Did UCLA inform the police department at any time during the year that premeditated, coordinated, non-affiliate harassment presented an elevated threat?

when confronted with the matter directly (walk out), block made a statement the next day that indicated deliberate indifference to the issue. It's at this point that when given sevaral opportunities to address one instance of severe harrassment, the school opted not to. They opted to site general safety (beck or someone wrote a statement about keeping campus safe at around the same time). 

Then treat the encampment issues as several events. (myers cited an event)

Was UCLA aware of the blockading for days (internal emails)
Was UCLA aware of the attack on the encampment the night before
Was UCLA aware of the massive social media response to the blockading
Did UCLA decide to use emotional framing in a social media post and public facing statment the evening following the mob harrassment of the encampment?
Did UCLA choose to use emotional framing in any other scenario concerning other vulnerable student groups?
Was UCLA aware the students were not leaving given they stated they would not go in the DB? (constructive notice)
Was UCLA aware of the heightened threat possibility given the harrassment that had occured thus far and the past incident?
Did UCLA inform UCPD to be prepared for a coordinated attack?
Did UCLA use any language as a deterrent from either harrassment or violence to try to mitigate hostilities up to that point?
If Block stated that the notice to clear the encampment was a security measure, why didn't they shut the encampment down?
Why didn't they shut the encampment down if it was behaving unlawfully and students were under threat?
He both removed the barriers (said in his statement) and declared the encampment unauthorized making it extremely unclear what expectations for students were (was the encampment still technically acting unlawfully, if so what was the basis for unauthorization?), regardless, they said they would not leave. that puts the responsibility on the university to keep them safe. and at that point anything they could have done would not have been enough because they already underassessed the threat potential. 


- visibility is one sided
- reputational harm is a big deal to ucla
- when something is visible ucla addresses it
- they don't believe that communication is actionable, they see it as reputational hygiene 
- but they do take measures to communicate with the community
	- dispelling rumors (that had media attention on chants)
	- kaplan incident (had a lot of social media attention)
- so they maintain a line of communication with stakeholders, e.g. outside community, media, organizations, social media, donors
- in high stakes situations they know that words matter
- high stakes visibility - words matter - they're doing reputational repair or dispelling rumors or whatever. They see these situations as "actionable" - situations where words can change outcomes. 
- high stakes severity - words do not matter. If words don't matter when threat levels are high, then what does matter? What measures did they take to directly and explicitly address harassment, and did they take those steps? 
- April 30th, words matter again, the spotlight is on the blockading. 2 things were happening at the same time, Block addressed the "visible" issue but ignored the "invisible" issue. But media "invisibility" does not make a threat any less real. Did the school take *real* steps to counter a very *real* threat? Or does the university simply see highly visible incidents as more serious? 
- from the Kaplan death threats it's clear that they knew about the line of communication with the community. Kaplan chain reaction is visibility - threats - violence. In that incident they addressed the visibility (the teach-in itself) but failed to stop the violence. They sought to dampen tensions by dispelling rumors but it still exploded on the other side. They just upped passive security without addressing either the unlawful activity or the clear discrimination. 
- In the encampment case, knowing it was a high stakes situation, they put fuel on the flames while completely exonerating the bad actors they were speaking directly to. 
- The school knows bad actors are on the line of comms (they showed up in a premeditated fashion to the kaplan meeting). The school took every possible measure, they transferred the meeting to zoom, they had sams there, they attempted to deescalate, and the scenario still exploded. No comms on the other side.
- On April 30th, there were no clear measures to move the threat targets, ie the students. They used confusing language to blur policy status of the encampment (the barriers won't go up again? the encampment is unauthorized on a flyer and at 5 pm? a statement conflicting with the statement made earlier that day?) and no clear directives were made. No dispersal order, no security threat statements, nothing. They then communicated directly with the broader community, a community that contained bad actors on the line, and added a layer of emotional harm to the administrative action taken. Again the situation exploded.
