## Testing whether severity, visibility, or group identity best predicts institutional action

- Follow separate threads of the same time periods

	- One is the dialogue and the "plot"

	- Follow the visibility 

		- who is responsible for some of that visibility? 

		- who is unwilling to be held accountable for the consequences of doing so? 

	- student sentiment (reddit, etc)

	- Reports, internal documents, retelling of the situation 

		- sams reports and the 21 solutions overlap

		- check the law suits against UCLA (check the benjamin-plaintiff lawsuit)

		- why is dialog across differences and not condemnation the way to handle these incidents (see icloud/records_requests)

			- like every rhetorical statement, they were talking to students and these people are not students!

			- Hillel showed they were bigger than their differences and came forward and said something

- The way they settled the last blockading lawsuit (quietly), they drew very little attention to the original issue or how it was resolved (from a mainstream standpoint)

	- so that might lead people to believe their behavior is influenced by media attention, but they continued with the same rhetoric throughout the April incident, even with helicopters flying overhead. 

- Would it have helped John Thomas to know that there were issues ongoing for a long period of time? Because if the police response needs to be of a certain "size," the size requirements are always met when facing the students, yet were not met when facing outside assailants? Was he aware that these people posed an ongoing threat to students? 

- the solution to unrest was upping security, spending tons of money, chilling free speech 

	- but even then there were issues with bias (June 10th)
