## This is built from the following documents

- 2025-03-07-Brainstorming-USAC.md
- 2025-02-10-Brainstorming-ideas-doc.md

## Tone direction

- No op-ed. Eliminate your opinion and any attempt to qualify anyone else's opinion. And don't be too suggestive when you group statements.

- Keep the free speech section in some form

- Keep the marketplace of ideas in some form


### Main concepts of a plan

- Pick the biggest themes from all your notes, this means pick the points that make up the overall thesis

- I know I have the plot, sources, and interpretations to back that up so make that secondary

- Divide it into several themes based on the biggest parallel points that run through the stories 

- Build from there

### Themes 

- Messaging to the UCLA community matters

	- There are tens of thousands of undergraduate students and hundreds of thousands in the greater community

	- Decisions cannot be ad hoc, especially in this day and age, when we have valuable policy and data-driven information 

	- These are not trivial matters relating to a local high school pep rally 

- A key theme is deliberate indifference 

- The difference between ignorance and willful ignorance 

	- willful ignorance became its own problem and endangered students

	- "Willful ignorance" refers to the act of deliberately choosing to avoid information or facts that could potentially be important or damaging, essentially deciding to remain uninformed on a subject despite having the ability to learn about it; it's often used when someone actively avoids knowledge to protect themselves from facing uncomfortable truths or potential consequences. 

**If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite “Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid” instead of just saying, “this was an unlawful obstruction”?**
**Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways and violence) to continue for days before acting? Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?** - this is really a big point. If rules were being broken then they should have shut it down, there and then. 
**Why did UCLA ignore student safety concerns about antisemitism when no laws were broken, but suddenly take those concerns seriously when laws were technically violated?** - they continued (even after April) ignoring issues with CAC, up until the point students had to infiltrate the group and surveil it from within
**UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.**
**What does it mean to "feel unsafe?"**
**I want to frame the reader’s mindset so that by the time they reach the riot, they fully grasp the institutional failures that led to it.**

- Events leading up to the encampment clearing - students were clearly denying students access to education by blockading pathways thereby breaking laws corresponding to time, place and manner rules, but Block framed it as a safety issue. 

	- Block made it clear in that moment his priority was to make the campus environment "safe" for all students

	- The issue I have is they **still haven't addressed** the counter-protesters, even now. They went after individuals, and arrested them. But they will not admit there is an issue and there still is an issue. Meanwhile they had no problem clumping all protesters together, condemning them, and making them a target. 

- UCLA maintains a policy of: 

- willful ignorance 

	- separate factions became so inflamed, that a sequence of events set off a premeditated act of domestic terrorism 

		- the counter-protesters planned the ambush on the encampment on the evening of April 30th in advance 

	- there is proof from words spoken by counter-protesters that evening that they were reacting directly to Chancellor Block's statement 

- heavy policing 

	- policing has always been a "point and shoot" tool

	- they never expected UCPD to handle policy 

	- they did when riots broke out 

- if people are violently harassed and/or sent to the hospital as a result of failures of UCLA policy

	- they are literally being denied access to their education 

- How much antisemitism is happening because the school is not enforcing policy? (need to follow up on all the EDI reports submitted)

- They're aware of misinformation spreading through the community -> posts on Twitter and death threats to English Dept. 

	- They're aware of the vast Jewish and pro-Israel connection with UCLA social media channels -> UCLA even posted ahead of the meeting to try to dispel rumors

- Even despite their best efforts to address "rumors" that did not change the violent outcome

	- It was the English Dept that opted to use an abundance of caution and move the teach in

- They witnessed the effect -> violence shown to students, and one parent

- Their solution had nothing to do with holding perpetrators accountable  

- they did not choose to publicly address the encampment, however the encampment did publicly respond 

	- Block claimed it was due to security issues (congressional hearing), that's why he wanted to shut it down that day, but he never stated that to the students, and never bothered to warn them when they released the statement that they would stay

	- there's also a video capture of someone saying "this is for blocking students and making them afraid" (reddit)

- Encampment communication's influence by media and the community was confirmed by the independent report

- reaction to encampment conduct made publicly, and directed at students

- reaction to pinata incident made publicly and directed at students 

- reaction to pig effigy made publicly and directed at students 

- at no point was there ever an explicit reaction to counterprotesters 

	- after the kaplan event

	- or during the April protest

- one-sided coverage serves to shape the public perception that only antisemitic incidents are happening 

- If not incumbent on the university to uphold policy, then it was at least incumbent on them to warn students of the danger that they were in (like some sort of disclaimer)

	- Block sent a campus-wide statement saying that the encampment made students feel threatened and afraid

	- Block told the House Committee that security issues were why they cleared the encampment 

	- At no point was there a public, campus-wide notice addressing protesting students for the purposes of danger mitigation

		- Title IX addresses broad-reaching notification requirements, as opposed to Title VI where information need only be "made available," a lower standard for safety, communication of the law, and protection of rights. UCLA opted to make information available to protesting students without concern that only a subset of protesting students may be getting this information  

		- There was an unclear message in the form of a flyer that students needed to leave 

			- There was no clear message that students were engaging in unlawful obstruction or were in immediate danger

			- Because the message was not campus-wide, only a subset of students were guaranteed to have received it

- Block's message was, "however one feels about the encampment"

	- how is this a content-neutral approach? Rhetoric was totally absent except for this. 

- absent rhetoric 

	- they don't want to be seen as assisting any cause in any way

		- whether assistance is in the form of ideological promotion (the cover)

		- or assisting in stopping the nuisance that protests created 

		- or protection of student safety 

- Block needed to take a position and choose rhetoric that would be **sure to ensure the safety of the largest number of students**

	- A very large number of students were feeling threatened and afraid at that point, including protesters that may or may not have been partaking in the blockading (or may or may not have been in support of the blockading)

	- **The only way** to ensure the safety of the largest number of students, would have been to issue a clear and immediate dispersal order to the encampment. That would have been the only "content-neutral" way to handle messaging 

- Why didn't they assist in ensuring areas of campus were not blocked? 

	- Did they care about clearing walkways for Jewish students and subjecting blockading students to student conduct hearings? 

	- If no, then did they care to notify the encampment of its unlawful obstruction?

	- If no, then did they care to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?

	- The university was content with allowing the blockading to go on for days, with no response 

		- During which time harassment by counter-protesters was becoming increasingly worse

		- Which could have contributed to the encampment's exclusionary behavior 

			- The university assisted in setting up barricades, officially 

	- The university's only official response was to shut the protest down using a confusing flyer and rhetoric that was sure to inflame already increasing tensions 

		- The Bruin stated that the Block had never called the encampment unlawful before 

		- Even if he were abundantly clear, the school waited so long to address encampment conduct, they had essentially trapped students and put them in harms way

		- (Need to ask Darnell Hunt and the students how their interactions went, it's possible he tried to communicate with them on the subject)

- CAC had been a major problem all year (even to get Shapiro's attention), potentially a major contributor to tensions between students, yet the school did nothing to stop them or address student concerns (who honestly cares about dialogue across differences if they can't stop the discrimination (and violence) happening that goes against policy first?)

	- The moment CAC entered the encampment (student funds) that raises eyebrows because there was clear discrimination happening from them (at this point they're crossing the line into pervasive)

	- The moment the encampment started blockading, and CAC was a part of it, and students pay student fees, Verdugo is out. 

	- Were there reports filed about CAC's encampment involvement? 

- Why did Block so willingly chastise the encampment for Jewish "fear" rather than cite the rules that were broken and state an actionable path to either ensure the encampment was functioning in line with campus policy or to disperse and shut it down entirely?

- The rules around free speech are fear-agnostic. If rules are broken the violation must be cited explicitly. It is incumbent on the administration to separately address and ameliorate fear that stems from rhetoric, activity, or incidents on campus.

	- In other words:  

	1. By totality of circumstances, does the fear meet the Title VI harassment and discrimination standard such that the behavior in question is no longer protected by 1A? 

	2. Should it not be a policy of the administration to *consistently* address incidents that may inflame tensions or impact student morale? Why when CAC and USAC were partaking in speech that clearly upset Jewish students, did the university not move to address student concerns? And why when CAC and USAC were in breach of campus policy, did the university not immediately state the policy violation and put an end to the offending behavior? 

- As the oversight body and mediator, the lack of action taken by the university resulted in inflamed tensions between students (is this provable?). The incorrect action was then taken when tensions were high, leading to unsafe conditions and violence. 

	- What is the real fear here? That free speech be truly allowed on campus? 

	- Or that the students get along? Or that there is some level of harmony on campus should the rules be carried out as intended? Is that the fear, the policy implications of a properly functioning campus?

	- It is not the responsibility of the administration to manufacture hostility on false pretenses. If this is the state of the world, let them learn it there. Unless it is their intention to release hostile individuals on an already disharmonious world, such that the US foreign policy and the goepolitical state of this world remains the same. 

- Myers wrote an article about the warring sides in forward (he mentioned something about the language they were speaking)

	- These are foreigners, putting foreign interests above our own, how long will we let this go on? 

### Jewish Students Call for Administrative Help from UCLA - the Call Goes Unanswered 

- They were allowing CAC and Verdugo (via Tsives and Shapiro) to be the face of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus

	- Despite the fact the group should have been condemned on numerous occasions and eventually shut down completely 

- When USAC began excluding it was clear they were compromised 

	- Jewish students called out the exclusion (winter)

	- It goes against school policy to exclude

	- Jewish students pay student fees, USAC uses these fees 

- Evidence against (CAC) continued to pile up, how much needed to accumulate? (flashback to post-Oct 7th incident)

	- X posts

	- Hostile environment by totality of circumstances 

- Jewish students had to take it upon themselves; it was clear that CAC was compromised when verdugo stepped down

	- But they called for her impeachment earlier (petition)

	- It was an impeachable offense to be in the encampment

	- Based on no condemnations by USAC for any antisemitic behavior on campus, or for blockading or any behavior breaking the rules, it was clear they weren't going to address issues 

	- Yet Jewish students didn't manage to begin the hearing process until the following academic year, after Verdugo had been voted in again by the student body 

		- Jewish students don't even have the representation necessary to change voting outcomes

		- Why are such extreme measures necessary when behavior is clearly violating policy? 

- The university didn't bother to weed out bad apples, which served to inflame tensions between student factions (Eli Tsives, who mentioned Verdugo by name) 

	- While at the same time, before the riots, no counterprotesters were addressed, putting ALL protesting students in serious danger 

- After the riots, the university chose to single out and pursue charges against specific rioters (who social media and CNN made the effort to ID)

	- Even then, charges against the hoodie guy, could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (his charges were lowered to misdemeanor I think, need to follow up on that)

	- That amounts to approximately five people, out of hundreds who showed up with weapons, fireworks, and contributed to violence and harassment 

- Did all protesting students have this coming? 

	- The person's quote saying that the encampment "had it coming"

### Media attention is driving responses

- Encampment communication's influence by media and the community was confirmed by the independent report

- reaction to encampment conduct made publicly, and directed at students

- reaction to pinata incident made publicly and directed at students 

- reaction to pig effigy made publicly and directed at students 

- at no point was there ever an explicit reaction to counterprotesters 

	- after the kaplan event

	- or during the April protest

- one-sided coverage serves to shape the public perception that only antisemitic incidents are happening 

- condemnation of only major incidents means

	- the school doesn't actually care about student welfare

	- the school and not the students is at fault for antisemitism on campus because they are not even trying to hold people accountable

### Administrative communication regarding encampment directives 

- If not incumbent on the university to uphold policy, then it was at least incumbent on them to warn students of the danger that they were in (like some sort of disclaimer)

	- Block sent a campus-wide statement saying that the encampment made students feel threatened and afraid

	- Block told the House Committee that security issues were why they cleared the encampment 

	- At no point was there a public, campus-wide notice addressing protesting students for the purposes of danger mitigation

		- There was an unclear message in the form of a flyer that students needed to leave 

			- There was no clear message that students were engaging in unlawful obstruction or were in immediate danger

			- Because the message was not campus-wide, only a subset of students were guaranteed to have received it

		- Students groups responded by saying "we will not leave"

			- It should have been clear to UCLA (via constructive notice) that the encampment would not be vacated that evening

			- If they had really intended on having the encampment cleared, and they knew that it would not be, why not take further administrative or security steps to address the encampment? 

				- Because they chose deliberate indifference to the situation 

					- They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the status of their own students

					- They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the lack of police presence and backup that would be available to them 

						- Did they indicate to John Thomas, who was watching a Dodgers game that evening, 

							- That they'd sent a message to the greater community saying Jewish students were feeling threatened and afraid?

							- That the protesting students responded by saying they will not leave? 

					- Did they bother to check what kind of police presence was available that evening, in the event tensions escalated beyond the days before? (this is a question for Thomas directly)

### Post-encampment notifications by UCLA

- It was incumbent on the university to notify students that they would be facing arrest

	- There was no clear message that continuing to camp on university grounds would result in arrest

		- Students within the encampment were told the afternoon before, in-person (by Hunt?)

		- The encampment was ambushed in the middle of the night 

			- There is no guarantee that all encampment students had adequate warning to leave or be arrested

### UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.

- This might just have to be student safety

- Students, and the community want to see the school is not just acting when the spotlight is on them

- It might not be up to the administration to "sane wash" the movement, but if they genuinely care about the welfare of targeted students (on both sides), they would address issues as they arise (on both sides)

	- Title VI and that policy doc encourage UCLA's input to the marketplace of ideas

- Need a different way to address Jewish anxiety without making it about every little thing

	- Bella Brannon, while she appreciates the effort, she doesn't think it's enough (the Bruin)

	- The triangle thing might just be too trivial, especially because they were removed right away

		- Maybe by pointing out that students were beginning to feel anxiety on Day 1, that antisemitism was happening on Day 1

		- CAC's encouragement of the red triangle and pig imagery and associating it to Block
	
		- The details of the Alicia Verdugo impeachment call 

			- CAC had been a major problem all year, potentially a major contributor to tensions between students, yet the school did nothing to stop them or address student concerns

			- This kind of imagery was only supported by a subset of groups

- Task force report on antisemitism 

- Task force on anti-Muslim/Arab hate

- Survey - no one trusts the administration 

	- They made certain parts of the survey optional 

		- Run the numbers, but the issue is not how low the score was before, but more the fact that they seemed to have deliberately made questions that weren't performing optional (in the case of reporting discrimination and harassment it was a 6% increase)

		- Check most recent UCUES data

- The bruin article 

	- on antisemitism

	- on campus safety

	- on anti-muslim/arab hate

- Talk to students?  

	- Did UCLA ever try to address CAC (probably not)

- The organization that said if UCLA doesn't do something then they will (Sukkah)

- Along with zero statements made about Kaplan the incident, there were also no statements made about tracking down the perpetrators 

	- When the Bruin inquired directly, a low-level administrator answered 

	- The student said herself she saw one of them at a pro-Israel vigil at around 7 pm 

		- How would it feel to know that masked assailants who may have ID'd a student were now free to attend campus events and be on campus at any time
	
	- There has been no evidence that UCLA attempted to track down the individuals responsible (you need to check that with SJP)

- The administration never kept students abreast of the status of criminal investigations regarding any non-student criminal activity

	- It has always been incumbent on students to keep track of the status of ID'd individuals (that CNN and social media largely ID'd) who may be dangerous

## Testing whether severity, visibility, or group identity best predicts institutional action

- Follow separate threads of the same time periods

	- One is the dialogue and the "plot"

	- Follow the visibility 

		- who is responsible for some of that visibility? 

		- who is unwilling to be held accountable for the consequences of doing so? 

	- student sentiment (reddit, etc)

	- the marketplace of ideas, who is trying (which Jewish group) is trying to "control the narrative" and which is arguing against exclusion in good faith?

		- is it possible there is rhetorical divergence at least with respect to chilling free speech (everyone including Hillel is entitled to their opinion, if they want to fight pro-palestinian speech, so be it. the question is, did they want to shut down free speech?)

			- were they proponents of rules that facilitated heckler's vetos and violence? 

			- or were they simply putting their own political hat (and at times condemnation) of pro-palestinian groups into the ring?

	- Reports, internal documents, retelling of the situation 

		- sams reports and the 21 solutions overlap

		- check the law suits against UCLA (check the benjamin-plaintiff lawsuit)

		- why is dialog across differences and not condemnation the way to handle these incidents (see icloud/records_requests)

			- like every rhetorical statement, they were talking to students and these people are not students!

			- Hillel showed they were bigger than their differences and came forward and said something

- The way they settled the last blockading lawsuit (quietly), they drew very little attention to the original issue or how it was resolved (from a mainstream standpoint)

	- so that might lead people to believe their behavior is influenced by media attention, but they continued with the same rhetoric throughout the April incident, even with helicopters flying overhead. 

- Would it have helped John Thomas to know that there were issues ongoing for a long period of time? Because if the police response needs to be of a certain "size," the size requirements are always met when facing the students, yet were not met when facing outside assailants? Was he aware that these people posed an ongoing threat to students? 

- the solution to unrest was upping security, spending tons of money, chilling free speech 

	- but even then there were issues with bias (June 10th)

- the jewish is always the visible stuff so that's what the school caters to, they're acting like a business 

	- ethnic social media always acts like a huge amplification network (across many nationalities and cultures), but how many Palestinians are there in the world? It's not a strong network

- OCR isn't doing it's job, so I'll do it for them (for fuck's sake)
