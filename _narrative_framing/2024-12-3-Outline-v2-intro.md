## Hook 1

Days after Oct 7th massacre, ...

Oct 9th 

"In a council meeting two days after the horrific October 7th terrorist attack, Jewish students shared how they had been affected, including students sharing that their loved ones were murdered."

"there is so much propaganda that those are quote-unquote Israelis, those are settlers."

## Pro-Palestinian groups

### CAC

On the same day as the council meeting, the Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA posted on their official Instagram profile. The first line of the post read, "The Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA stands in solidarity with Palestinians in their struggle for liberation from Israel." It also stated, "We also stand on the grounds that decolonization is not a metaphor. **Thus, we honor the Palestinians on the frontlines taking their land and sovereignty back!**"

### SJP

On that same day, Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA posted on Instagram, "Emergency Teach-In On The Crisis in Palestine." "UCLA Professors Makdisi and Razack will be convening a teach-in Wednesday, October 11th both online and in person. **If you are a student seeking more clarity, information, and perspectives on recent escalations in Palestine, we highly encourage you to attend.**"

## Hook 2

Oct 11

 "I'm going to rip your fucking head off

You motherfucker

You better fucking run from me terrorist"


(Student Affairs)


## Chancellor Block

Chancellor Block responded to the Oct 7th attack a few days later.

Oct 13th 

“Only six days ago, a heinous assault was perpetrated upon Israeli civilians by the terror organization 
Hamas, a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly as well as the taking of innocent hostages. Earlier this week, I joined UC leadership in condemning this attack, and as new details have emerged, I can only denounce it further: This was a grievous act of malice and hate. It was, I am pained to say, the largest one-day killing of Jews since the end of the Holocaust.

Since then, Israel has responded to the assault, **leading to a significant loss of Palestinian lives 
and the troubling displacement of large numbers of innocent individuals.**”

“This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many 
intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand 
firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. 
I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, 
but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. **We must not devolve into violating 
one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment 
should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or 
threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911.**”

### r/UCLA

Oct 13th

Within hours discussions began in response. 

"**How can we believe that the UC cares about both Palestinian lives and Israeli lives**, if the 
chancellor puts out this statement. "Grievous" "malice" "despicable" vs. "troubling". Are you joking?"

"They do care about all lives. However not denouncing Hamas when it's a well known terrorist group 
and a religious extremist group would be disgusting."

"You're directing attention away from the point. They denounced Hamas. I never said they shouldn't 
do so. However, they DID NOT denounce the ethnic cleansing that's been ensuing since. That's the point. 
I'm convinced you're choosing to be dense rn."

### Response SJP

Oct 16

"In Chancellor Gene Block's recent statement via mass email, the UC perpetuates Zionist rhetoric by 
justifying the brutal occupation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, naming the Zionist 
regime's genocidal attacks on Gaza as simply a response to "terrorist" attacks. **However, we know 
that Al-Aqsa Flood is not unprovoked.** It is a response to over 75 years of brutal Zionist 
colonization, occupation, ethnic cleansing, the denial of Palestinian refugees' right to return 
to their ancestral homeland, relentless attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque, and indiscriminate bombardment."


## UCLA policy

### UCLA philosophy and policy 

The incidents that occurred and reactions from students can be better understood within the
context of UCLA's mission.

"UCLA’s primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and 
application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society.

To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access 
to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from 
intolerance."

This is a bit sugarcoated. In its search for truth, academia permits an unfettered exchange of ideas. 

This is in contrast to "everyday" exchanges which may be qualified for the sake of orthodoxy or 
propriety---a societal construct. Truth is absolute. This means it may be shocking or come with hate, and in our search to find it, it may not be present at all.

Naturally then, academic freedom and free speech go hand in hand, they protect and 
facilitate one another.

“The freedom to communicate (speech) and the (academic) freedom to inquire are both essential to 
the university’s fundamental mission, “which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it 
to its students and to society at large.””

Discovering knowledge puts the university on the cutting edge of new ideas. The edge is not a place where 
everyone may be "comfortable;" consequently UCLA relies on the First Amendment to protect academic speech. 

“Does the First Amendment apply to UCLA? Yes, because as an extension of the California government, 
UCLA is a state actor. So, if UCLA constrains your freedom of speech, then the First Amendment most 
definitely applies.”

### SJP 

To understand why a political position that sides with a known terrorist organization is protected by the First Amendment
we use UCLA's "two way street" principle. 

Neither the United states, nor the countries bordering Gaza, Israel and Egypt, recognize Hamas. The reasons are numerous, with insurgency and smuggling, militant alliances, border security issues, and political and ideological tensions chief among them. 

For the sake of the "Palestinian perspective" we focus on Israel. 

Israel does not recognize Hamas. They are a de facto government in Gaza. Hamas in turn does not recognize Israel.  

While Gaza has not been directly occupied since 2005, the combination of Israel’s military operations, the perimeter blockade’s humanitarian toll, and border violence has led to significant Palestinian deaths, which groups like Hamas cite as part of their grievances.

It is the case that innocent civilians have been murdered as part of Israel's de facto occupation of Gaza, and it is also the case that innocent civilians were murdered in the Hamas attack within Israel's border. 

If, at its core, land and sovereignty are underlying issues in the this conflict, then America's history also harbors sordid acts---the murder and displacement of innocent civilians---over contested land. 
  
Accordingly, if any party may deem another "terrorist" depending on the lens used in judgement, then the word for moral purposes has lost all meaning. 

From an academic lens, who they "are" based on a societal qualification is irrelevant. We understand an
entity by the first principles of their actions based only in factual evidence. 

Dismissing the words of our "enemies" risks overlooking a measure of truth they may hold. Without prejudice, we look at the evidence to validate or reject each claim. 

Since the beginning of time academics have reserved the right to to this, free from oppression or persecution, free from what the government or society tells us. 
 

### The Reddit exchange

We don't know who the two anonymous users are in this exchange. They may both be American, or not. OP was sensitive to the Chancellor's word choice based on their own experience. It is unclear if on any level they're "factoring in" Israel's close alliance with the United States. 

Americans, including myself, who have factored Israel in, might looks at the statement and not notice the disparate language. Even acknowledging the loss of Palestinian lives less than a week after Oct 7th shows more balance than one might ever see from the mainstream media or certain government officials. 

This "factoring in" is also a societal construct. At universities, when we clash and these constructs break away, the truth lies somewhere within. 

### CAC 

In the Oct 9th statement, CAC also states, "Palestinians should be recognized for their care for the oppressed, and not levied with accusations that conflate the political ideology of zionism with Judaism." It is unclear here how they are defining "zionism." But, based on the statement "Israel is a colonial power that oppresses Palestinians...We oppose this oppressive settler power," it is assumed that Israel is considered a Zionist entity and its statehood is illegitimate in the eyes of CAC. This is a political opinion, and it is protected by the First Amendment. 

In the exchange at the council meeting, however, **the CAC Commissioner participated in discrimination based on national origin**.

Her statement collapsed nationality into ideology, and assumed anyone who is Israeli is inherently supportive of Zionist policies, regardless of their personal beliefs or political positions. It ignored any possibility for diversity of thought within Israel, where a wide spectrum of perspectives on issues like the occupation, settlements, and peace with Palestinians may exist.  

Her words **implied that Israelis "deserve to die"** by virtue of being Israeli alone. 

The discrimination becomes clearer when applying UCLA’s two-way street principle. Following the commissioner's logic, Americans—including those strongly opposed to settler-colonialism—would also be deserving of harm solely due to their nationality and its historical context.

If the commissioner discriminated, how might UCLA view her conduct? Isn't she allowed to exercise her right to free speech? Yes she is. 

Student speech is protected under the First Amendment, even if it is offensive or controversial.

**“But as a descriptive statement of law, the assertion “hate speech is not free speech” is just plain wrong.** The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws—including university “speech codes”— that penalize or otherwise regulate “hate speech.””

“There is no exception from the First Amendment on the basis of the hateful nature of a speaker’s statements. On its own, the fact that speech may cause emotional harm to others cannot provide the basis for UC to prohibit it”

There are exceptions,

“Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment…**means freedom of speech can sometimes be constrained to further the right to equality.** The reality—and challenge—is that sometimes equality gives way to freedom of speech, and vice versa.”

For practical purposes the exceptions are defined as,

Discrimination---"the **exclusion of a person**, on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion,…**from participation in any academic**, research or other University service, program or activity.”

Or,

Harassment---"conduct that is **sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit an individual’s ability to participate** in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities offered by the University, or creates a work environment that is intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

Sanctions may be enhanced where an individual was selected for harassment because of the individual’s race, color, national or ethnic origin," etc.

We see in both cases, discrimination or harassment must be so severe so as to deprive victims of access to education. 

Mild or isolated offensive speech, even if discriminatory, is unlikely to override First Amendment protections.

"Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, **the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as “unprotected speech” and “less protected speech” narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future.**” 


### The non-affiliates

What about students who were confronted by non-affiliated visitors at the teach-in?

While speech is protected under the First Amendment, even if offensive or controversial, it cannot cross the line into true harassment or violence.

“Remember that **certain forms of speech, such as true threats...**, are unprotected under the First Amendment. There’s a reason why these forms of speech are unprotected (or less protected); as a general rule, it’s understood that they cause concrete harm and provide little if any social value. **UCLA is largely free to regulate those forms of speech** and it should attempt to do so.”

Discriminatory actions or speech that escalate to threats, intimidation, or physical violence are extremely serious. This incident was no exception. 

## Hook 3 

In a Daily Bruin article,'Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus', published on Nov 19th, 

"**Benjamin Kersten, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace at UCLA** – a coalition of Jewish students who support Palestinian liberation – said he thinks it is important to distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. However, they added that they and their organization believe that **Jewish grief is being used as a justification for oppression in the Gaza Strip.**

“There’s been a lot of repression on campus and a lot of claims that criticism of the state of Israel or that anti-Zionism is antisemitic,” Kersten said. “We’re here to very soundly say that that’s not the case. **We’re loud and proud anti-Zionist Jews** who feel very rooted in our Jewishness and in our values of equality and justice.”"

## Hook 4

The statement by Kersten demonstrates the diversity of thought at UCLA. His point about Jewish grief, the repression of criticism of Israel and its conflation with antisemitism may be valid. This could have been happening. 

"Often people emphasize that the antidote to (bad, including hateful) speech is more (good)
speech. They reassure us that in the “marketplace of ideas,” truth will always win out. But
that’s an empirical claim, and if inspected carefully, seems naive. In the marketplace of
music, fashion, and food, winners are often determined by popularity, not by what’s best,
the highest quality, or the most truthful."

The question becomes whether the entire truth can get lost within prevailing theories, or whether the theories themselves can change the way we see the truth. 

Anyone not deeply involved may only hear, "people are claiming antisemitism when it's only criticism of Israel."

It doesn't help when far-Right news outlets, who regularly engage in hyperbole, co-opt the story in a fight against the "radical Left." "The radical Left is being antisemitic, they hate all White oppressors."

Or when the ADL claims that anti-Zionism is antisemitism but the ACLU and other legislature have pushed back calling its definition too broad. 

Where is the truth? At this point we risk tuning out any claims of antisemitism for any of the above reasons. 

The same article brought up an incident that occurred 10 days before,

"At a Nov. 8 rally in support of Palestine, which was hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine and UC Divest Coalition at UCLA, participants were invited to destroy piñatas with pictures of United States President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on them."

As participants crowded around a pinata of Netanyahu an individual holding a megaphone yelled,

"Beat that fucking Jew!"

 Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

[Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"


## Chancellor Block

The Nov 8th incident was antisemitic hate speech and warranted [condemnation by Block and Drake](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) on Nov 10th. Rightly so, while the words shouted may have been few, the impact was magnified by the fact that the incident occurred at a large rally. 

Nov 10th

"Today, I joined University of California President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors in issuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses — including UCLA — over the past several weeks. We must be crystal clear: discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding."

"At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. **While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment**, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. **Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable.**"


### Response by a student in the Daily Bruin dated Nov 19

In a Daily Bruin article,'Students voice worries over Islamophobia on UCLA campus', also published on Nov 19th, a Palestinian student stated

"that they feel **the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus** because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than Palestinian students.”" 


### CAC 

Another Bruin article, 'UCLA faces scrutiny for safety issues at protests for Israel, Palestine,' dated Dec 5th, brought attention to allegations made by CAC after a rally in support of Israel on Nov. 7th in an Instagram post.

The post echoed the student's sentiment from the earlier article. 

“Just today, students were selling Kuffiyas on campus on Bruinwalk when older non-students started shoving them. Throughout the day, non-students harassed, threatened, and assaulted BIPOC students, and nothing was done by campus security teams—including UCPD. More than ever, it is clear that there is no safety for…students supporting Palestine on campus. UCLA has still not released even a statement to acknowledge, let alone condemn the hate crimes, harassment, and violence students have faced for years.

We call on UCLA, the UC, and other entities of this institution to protect students from the violence that is waged by both students and non-students on you own campuses. We call on campus resources to be more accessible to students facing imminent and indirect danger from Islamophobic, Zionist, and anti-Palestinian violence.”

## Comparison 

Is there weight to the claims that the security of pro-Palestine students are at risk due to unequal handling of incidents by the administration?

"I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. We must not devolve into violating one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911.”

Vs

"At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable."

In both statements Block made, there is no explicit condemnation of unlawful acts towards students occurring on either Oct 11th or Nov 7th. 

Without proof the severity of the Nov 7th incident is unclear. The incident occurring on Oct 11th, however, was captured on video. At a walkout march on Oct 25th, 

“Several speakers brought attention to recent allegations of attacks against pro-Palestinian students on campus."

When the Daily Bruin inquired about the allegations, in an emailed statement a UCLA spokesperson

"said members of the student affairs team intervened in response to students at Kaplan Hall allegedly experiencing harassment while attempting to watch a teach-in on their computers. The spokesperson added that the university is still investigating the incident with an eye to holding individuals in violation of university rules and the law accountable.

“While we don’t believe the individuals who caused the incident are students or affiliated with our campus, we strongly encourage all community members to engage in thoughtful debate and treat everyone with respect,” they said in the statement.”"

(Inquire with UCPD, the result of this)


### OCR 

How might an independent agency tracking accountability factor in thus far? Brian Gnandt, Regional Program Manager at the Office of Civil Rights illuminates the concept of constructive notice, 

“A recipient is charged with constructive notice of a hostile environment if, upon reasonably diligent inquiry in the exercise of reasonable care, it should have known of the discrimination.”

“In other words, if the recipient could have found out about the harassment had it made a proper inquiry, and if the recipient should have made such an inquiry, knowledge of the harassment will be imputed to the recipient.”

The above statement by the UCLA spokesperson acknowledges "notice," they are aware the incident took place. Gnandt goes on to say,

“Once a recipient has actual or constructive notice of a hostile environment, the recipient has a legal duty to take reasonable steps to eliminate it. OCR evaluates the appropriateness of the responsive action by assessing whether it was reasonable, timely, and effective.”

The university's efforts to track down the perpetrators and the statements made were effectively their measures, or "reasonable steps" taken to eliminate a hostile environment. 

It becomes questionable whether the steps taken were the "appropriate responsive action" to mitigate any future harassment that might occur. For example, given the circumstances,

Charges brought for intimidation, property damage, attempted assault characterized by bias. Cited for harassment and disruption of university operations. Given a no-contact order. would have been appropriate. 

But instead the perpetrators were permitted to leave the premises by student affairs personnel without a warning. 

Block also did not find it necessary to get directly involved but found it acceptable to leave the task to others within the administration. 

Additionally, both statements made by Block and the university spokesperson used vague words promoting "harmony" within the UCLA community rather than serious warnings against further harassment. 

### Hillel 

On Oct 12, Hillel at UCLA, the largest Jewish campus organization at UCLA, posted a statement on their Instagram account.

"There are reports of some incidents in the last few days where students of different backgrounds and views have been harassed or intimidated. This is not acceptable and Hillel believes there is NO justification for any type of aggression towards any students.  

We also call on agitators in the outside communities to stay away from campus. Your acts of aggression---no matter what your views are---are not welcome at UCLA. We know that many of the reported incidents were caused by non-students and we condemn them in the strongest terms. 

The conflict between Israel and Hamas does not need to spill over and poison our campus. We all mourn. Hate at UCLA will never be the answer."

In the weeks following Oct 7th, the "marketplace of emotion" was flooded with grief, understandably so.

Would the statement made by Hillel such a short time after Oct 7th, recognizing Palestinian grief be considered popular? In the "marketplace of ideas" we know truth can be denied because it is unpopular. 

The question must be raised, were matters between student groups being managed in a content-neutral fashion, or did the administration also subscribe to this marketplace? In other words, did some students "have what was coming to them" based on who they were or what they believed?
