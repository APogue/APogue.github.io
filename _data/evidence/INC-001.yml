  sources: [SOC-006]

target_tone:

  sources: [SOC-008]

admin_response_level: minimal
justification: "Although the administration issued an incident-specific statement, it included no proposed accountability and offered no referral to student services. Per automated logic rules, this constitutes a symbolic response and is downgraded to minimal."
