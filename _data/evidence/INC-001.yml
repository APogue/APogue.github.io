# Structured Qualitative
administrative_tone:
  value: condemnation
  justification: "ADM-001 uses strong language: 'We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic

# Unstructured Qualitative
notes: "The incident occurred during a multi-day protest against the UC Regents related to divestment demands during the 
Israel-Gaza conflict. The antisemitic effigy incorporated classical antisemitic tropes including depicting Jews as pigs, 
association with money/greed, and featured the Star of David. UCLA's response came a week after the incident, following 
public pressure from Jewish organizations including the ADL."
