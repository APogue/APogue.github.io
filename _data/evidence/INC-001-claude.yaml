    Executive Director Dan Gold wrote that 'BDS activists camped out' and made a scene, 
    including 'ugly displays and slogans.'\" The display was part of organized protest 
    activities. Image 5 shows an Instagram post from ucladivest that states: \"During

  justification: "DB-001: \"To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it 
    is impossible not to recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with 
    pigs – or, more accurately, with their coarse and animal-like quality.\" MED-001: 
    \"The university said: 'We are offended and deeply saddened by the ugly antisemitic 
    caricature that was displayed as part of a protest aimed at the University of California 
    Board of Regents that met at UCLA on Wednesday and Thursday of this week.'\" These

media_coverage_level:
  value: moderate
  justification: "Following the media_coverage_level protocol: I have identified exactly 
    9 qualifying sources: MED-001 (Jewish Journal), ADL California's statement (Image 2), 
    Israel War Room's post (Image 1), Reddit post in r/Jewish (Image 4), Instagram post 
    from ucladivest (Image 5), Reddit comments (Images 6-7), and multiple social media 
    responses across different platforms. Of these, the following have general public reach: 
    Israel War Room's tweet showing 10.8K views and ADL California's tweet with 40.8K views. 
    MED-001 also indicates coverage in The Los Angeles Times: \"According to The Los Angeles 
    Times, one of the issues discussed during the UC Regents meeting was a proposal requiring 
    faculty departments to put any polemical commentary statements up to a vote before 
    posting...\" This meets the criteria for 'moderate' because there are at least 5 sources 
    across ecosystems, including at least two with general public reach."

    antisemitic caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University 
    of California Board of Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March.\" MED-001: \"The

    were holding their meeting.\" Both sources confirm the incident occurred on UCLA's campus."

policy_status:
  value: violated
  justification: "After reviewing POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, and PHIL-001 in their entirety, 
    I have determined that this incident violated university policy. 

    POL-003: \"The Anti-Discrimination Policy ('Policy') applies to all University of 
    California ('University') employees as well as undergraduate, graduate, and professional 
    students ('students'), and third parties.\" Section III.A of POL-003 states: 
    \"Discrimination and Harassment pose a serious threat to the University's mission, 
    values, and reputation... Prohibited Conduct violates this Policy and may violate the law.\"

    PHIL-001: \"Even though UCLA as 'sovereign' cannot suppress speech simply because it 
    disagrees with its message, UCLA as 'speaker' may pick a side and share its beliefs... 
    UCLA may loudly and proudly embrace equity, diversity, and inclusion while fervently 
    rejecting inequity, homogeneity, and exclusion. This includes publicly denouncing hate speech.\"

    ADM-001: \"We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic 
    caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California 
    Board of Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March.\"

    DB-001: \"To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not 
    to recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with pigs... So too the 
    juxtaposition between a hand holding a birdcage – presumably to symbolize the lack of 
    freedom of Palestinians – and a hand holding a bag of money triggers alarms for those 
    familiar with the history of antisemitism.\"

    Weighing the nature of the display against UCLA's obligations as a state actor bound by 
    the First Amendment, the display appears to violate POL-003's prohibition against 
    Harassment, which is defined as: \"Unwelcome conduct based on an individual's actual or 
    perceived Protected Category... that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive 
    that it unreasonably interferes with, denies, or adversely limits an individual's 
    participation in or benefit from the education, employment, or other programs or 
    activities of the University, and creates an environment that a reasonable person would 
    find to be intimidating or offensive.\" The display used recognized antisemitic imagery 
    (pig with money bag and Star of David) in a way that created an intimidating environment 
    for Jewish students."

policy_violation_type:
  value: anti_discrimination
  justification: "POL-003: \"Harassment: Unwelcome conduct based on an individual's actual 
    or perceived Protected Category ... that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive

    participation in or benefit from the education, employment, or other programs or 
    activities of the University, and creates an environment that a reasonable person would 
    find to be intimidating or offensive.\" The display used recognized antisemitic tropes 
    that targeted a protected category (religion/Jewish identity). The university's official 
    statement in ADM-001 characterized it as an \"ugly antisemitic caricature\" that was a 
    \"complete affront to UCLA's Principles of Community and True Bruin Values.\""

  value: bias/discrimination
  justification: "DB-001: \"To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is 
    impossible not to recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with pigs... 
    Medieval Christian Europe was replete with statues and carvings of the Judensau, the 
    so-called 'Jews' pig,' which depicted Jews suckling at the udders of a sow... So too 
    the juxtaposition between a hand holding a birdcage – presumably to symbolize the lack 
    of freedom of Palestinians – and a hand holding a bag of money triggers alarms for those 
    familiar with the history of antisemitism.\" This shows that the incident involved 
    identity-based derogatory expression perceived as hostile toward a protected group, 
    using recognized antisemitic imagery."

severity_score:
  value: moderate
  justification: "Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows absence of direct 
    physical harm, absence of credible physical threats, but presence of distress and some disruption.
    
    MED-001: \"Gold told the Journal in a text message that Jewish students 'were very 
    disturbed, upset and concerned' about the pig display.\" 
    
    Image 4: \"At UCLA today. This is why I'm scared of going to campus as an Israeli Jew.\"
    
    This incident does not qualify for 'elevated' because there is no evidence of 
    institutional escalation such as dispersal orders, event shutdown, or police mobilization. 
    The incident is properly classified as 'moderate' because there was some disruption and 
    documented distress among Jewish students, but no evidence of physical confrontation, 
    arrests, or university shutdown."

police_involvement:
  value: none
  justification: "After reviewing all provided sources, there is no mention of police 
    involvement, intervention, or presence related to this specific incident. ADM-001,

  value: 7
  justification: "The incident occurred March 21, 2024 as stated in MED-001: \"The Israel 
    War Room X account posted an image of the display on Thursday, March 21; the display 
    had the words 'UC Regents' in front of flames and a clock behind it that said, 'Time 
    is running out.'\" The administrative response was issued on March 28, 2024 as shown 
    in ADM-001: \"Campus condemns antisemitic caricature at UC Regents meeting March 28, 2024\". 
    The difference between these dates is 7 days."

  justification: "ADM-001: \"We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly 
    antisemitic caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University 
    of California Board of Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March.\" The administration's 
    statement uses strong language denouncing the display as morally wrong and harmful, 
    calling it \"hateful and racist\" and \"a complete affront to UCLA's Principles of 
    Community and True Bruin Values.\" This language clearly condemns the specific behavior 
    as unacceptable and against institutional standards."

    the civil rights of all students, particularly focusing on respect, dignity, and 
    protecting rights in response to this incident."

  value: group_targeting
  justification: "MED-001: \"The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of 
    California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing 
    every day. Students and faculty across California are impacted by this hateful bigotry 
    and it must come to an end.\" This statement from ADL Los Angeles Regional Director 
    frames the incident as harassment targeting a particular group (Jewish students). 
    DB-001: \"Sadly, there are too few voices – at least, audible ones – that are willing 
    to acknowledge, at once, the Hamas-perpetrated massacre of Oct. 7 and the ongoing 
    devastation that Israel has wrought in Gaza... Another victim of the current moment 
    is the ability to extend beyond ourselves to understand the other, especially those 
    with whom one disagrees.\" This framing focuses on how the incident reflects harassment 
    and discrimination against Jewish students."

  value: defiant
  justification: "I reviewed the following sources containing actor tone indicators: 
    MED-001, Image 3, Image 5.
    
    Found approximately 3 references to defiant tone (100%), 0 references to other tones (0%).
    
    Evidence for defiant tone:
    Image 3: Comment from Jeanne states: \"Antizionism isn't Antisemitism! They need to 
    stop conflating the two. I hate Zionists but have no issues with Jews\" - showing a 
    rejection of criticism and defiance.
    
    Image 5: ucladivest Instagram post: \"During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down 
    through various actions such as propping up Tent City, students camping out near 
    Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents and 
    showcasing a reminder of the disparate conditions many Palestinian refugees face 
    due to ongoing genocide.\" This indicates a defiant attitude toward authority, 
    proudly describing how they made their presence \"inescapable\" to the Regents.
    
    MED-001: \"pro-Palestinian protesters shouted 'shame on you!' and accused Sures of 
    attempting to censor their point of view.\" This shows defiance against authority 
    figures during the meeting.
    
    Based on this quantitative analysis, defiant tone represents 100% of tone references, 
    meeting the 60% threshold for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding is 'defiant'."

    its very easy. many jews have been anti israel since before you guys even cared. so 
    i don't understand why its difficult to grasp how and why this is antisemitic. and 
    why you guys refuse to listen to jews when they tell you something is antisemitic.\"
    
    Evidence for accusatory:
    DB-001: \"It is hard not to see the staging of the two hands – the upper hand holding 
    money and the lower hand holding the birdcage – as a visual representation of Jews' 
    domination of Palestinians.\"
    
    Image 7: Comment: \"i'm talking about jews with legitimate fears because they HAVE to 
    be knowledgeable on all forms of antisemitism, and this is a big in your face one. 
    to deny that is actually disgusting, and shows that you would rather shut down a 
    group with valid fears than acknowledge something you could look up yourself.\"
    
    Based on this quantitative analysis, fear/distress represents 71% of tone references, 
    exceeding the 60% threshold for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding

    justice, equality and freedom for Palestinians, which many Jews strongly support, 
    will not be advanced by recourse to antisemitic stereotypes.\" These quotes indicate 
    that Jewish campus members framed their objections to the display in terms of their 
    right to equal treatment, dignity, and to be free from discrimination, while 
    acknowledging Palestinian rights as well."

notes:
  value: "A statue depicting a pig holding a money bag and Star of David canister was 
    displayed during protests at a UC Regents meeting at UCLA on March 20-21, 2024. 
    The display was part of a multi-day pro-Palestinian protest calling for UC divestment. 
    The university administration condemned the display as antisemitic in a statement 
    released a week after the incident. Jewish students and faculty described the imagery 
    as invoking classic antisemitic tropes, while protest organizers defended their actions 
    as anti-Zionist rather than antisemitic. The incident occurred within the context of 
    ongoing campus tensions following October 7, 2023."
