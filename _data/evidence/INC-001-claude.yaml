 value: true
 justification: "MED-001: \"During the meeting, pro-Palestinian students spoke out during public comment, 
 where they urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that support the 'ongoing genocide and ethnic 
 cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times.\" MED-001: \"During March 19-21, students and community 
 from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the 
 genocide of Palestinians.\" Based on these quotes, it appears the protest, which included the pig 
 effigy display, was organized by students from UC campuses, indicating organizational affiliation."

 caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board of 
 Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March. The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been 
 removed. Hateful and racist depictions like this are a complete affront to UCLA's Principles of 
 Community and True Bruin Values, and to the diverse, inclusive academic community we aim to cultivate.\" 
 While the administration condemned the display, there is no mention of any specific follow-up 
 disciplinary action, investigation, or accountability processes mentioned in the administrative response."

admin_support_offered:
 value: positive_inclusion
 justification: "ADM-001: \"It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well 
 as those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity. We remain committed 
 to doing all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.\" 
 This statement explicitly affirms the dignity and rights of Jewish members of the community, which 
 meets the definition of positive_inclusion as described in the codebook."

actor_group:
 value: Palestinian
 justification: "MED-001: \"During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried 
 out a 3 day sit-in to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians.\" 
 MED-001: \"A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that support the 
 'ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times.\" These quotes identify 
 the actors as pro-Palestinian protesters."
 sources: [MED-001]

target_group:
 value: Jewish
 justification: "DB-001: \"To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible 
 not to recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with pigs – or, more accurately, 
 with their coarse and animal-like quality.\" MED-001: \"ADL Los Angeles Regional Director Jeffrey I. 
 Abrams said in a statement posted to social media, 'The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a 
 University of California campus speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing 
 every day.'\" These quotes clearly identify Jews as the target group of the offensive display."
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

media_coverage_level:
 value: network-amplified
 justification: "Following the media_coverage_level protocol: I have identified exactly 5 qualifying sources: 
 MED-001 (Jewish Journal coverage), plus sources documented in MED-001 including Israel War Room X account post, 
 ADL Los Angeles statement, UCLA Hillel Executive Director statement, and LA Times coverage. 
 
 While these sources represent significant coverage, they remain primarily within Jewish and/or academic 
 news ecosystems, without clear evidence of broad mainstream pickup beyond these networks. The sources 
 referenced do not specifically indicate that this incident reached the viewership threshold (≥100k views) 
 required for 'high' classification. 
 
 This meets the criteria for 'network-amplified' because there are at least 5 sources within a single 
 ecosystem, without clear evidence of mainstream pickup beyond these communities."
 sources: [MED-001]

location:
 value: on-campus
 justification: "ADM-001: \"We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic 
 caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board of 
 Regents meeting on our campus in mid-March.\" MED-001: \"The display was in front of the UCLA Luskin 
 Conference Center, where the UC Board of Regents were holding their meeting.\" These quotes confirm 
 the incident occurred on UCLA's campus."
 sources: [ADM-001, MED-001]

policy_status:
 value: compliant
 justification: "After reviewing POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, and PHIL-001 in their entirety, I have 
 determined that this incident is technically compliant with university policy from a speech perspective.

 PHIL-001: \"Lots of people say 'Hate Speech is NOT Free Speech.' But this inaccurately describes the law: 
 there is no categorical exception for 'hate speech.' Notwithstanding the harm it causes, 'hate speech' 
 is protected speech.\"

 PHIL-001: \"Even though UCLA as 'sovereign' cannot suppress speech simply because it disagrees with its 
 message, UCLA as 'speaker' may pick a side and share its beliefs. UCLA can, and should, exercise the full 
 power of its bully pulpit to speak our values. When UCLA speaks, it need not be neutral. To the contrary, 
 UCLA may loudly and proudly embrace equity, diversity, and inclusion while fervently rejecting inequity, 
 homogeneity, and exclusion. This includes publicly denouncing hate speech, whether that speech is expressed 
 by members of the UCLA community or by those invited into our fold.\"

 POL-001 Section 100004 indicates that for non-affiliates, demonstrations require prior approval from the 
 Designated University Official, but for students (as the actors were), POL-002 provides for the right to 
 free expression while following time, place, and manner regulations.

 Weighing the offensive nature of the speech against UCLA's obligations as a state actor bound by the First 
 Amendment, this incident does not rise to the level of unprotected speech as defined in the PHIL-001 
 categorical exceptions. While the display used antisemitic imagery and was condemned by the university, 
 it does not appear to meet the high threshold for harassment that would constitute a policy violation, as 
 it did not create a sustained pattern that substantially impaired any individual's access to university 
 programs or activities. UCLA's strong condemnation of the display is consistent with its right to disagree 
 with the message while still recognizing the speech as protected."
 sources: [PHIL-001, POL-001, POL-002]

policy_violation_type:
 value: none
 justification: "As explained in the policy_status justification, after reviewing POL-001, POL-002, POL-003, 
 and PHIL-001 in their entirety, although the display contained offensive antisemitic imagery, it does not 
 appear to have violated any specific university policy. PHIL-001: \"Notwithstanding the harm it causes, 
 'hate speech' is protected speech.\" Since no policy violation was identified, the appropriate coding is 'none'."
 sources: [PHIL-001]

norm_violation_type:
 value: bias/discrimination
 justification: "DB-001: \"To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not to 
 recoil. Since the 13th century, Jews have been associated with pigs – or, more accurately, with their coarse 
 and animal-like quality.\" 
 
 DB-001: \"It is hard not to see the staging of the two hands – the upper hand holding money and the lower 
 hand holding the birdcage – as a visual representation of Jews' domination of Palestinians. But what would 
 seem to be the real tell with respect to the statue's ultimate meaning is the blue and white bucket at the 
 bottom left of the pig, which is emblazoned with a star of David.\" 
 
 ADM-001: \"We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic caricature that was 
 displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board of Regents meeting on our campus 
 in mid-March.\" 
 
 These quotes indicate the display involved derogatory expression perceived as hostile toward a protected 
 group, fitting the definition of bias/discrimination norm violation."
 sources: [DB-001, ADM-001]

severity_score:
 value: low
 justification: "Based on the verification checklist, this incident shows absence of direct physical harm, 
 absence of credible risk to physical safety, absence of disruption to campus operations, and absence of 
 escalation that affected individuals, operations, or safety.

 ADM-001: \"The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed.\" 
 
 MED-001: \"During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down through various actions such as propping up Tent City, 
 students camping out near Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents and 
 showcasing a reminder of the disparate conditions many Palestinian refugees face due to ongoing genocide.\"
 
 This incident does not qualify for 'moderate' severity because there is no evidence of disruption requiring 
 a response from authorities, confrontations, or property damage. While the display was offensive, there is 
 no documentation in the sources of any measurable interference with university operations or institutional 
 safety. The incident is properly classified as 'low' severity because while the display caused offense, 
 there was no credible threat or physical harm documented, and any disturbance was brief and self-resolving 
 without requiring intervention."
 sources: [ADM-001, MED-001]

police_involvement:
 value: none
 justification: "After examining all provided sources, there is no mention of police involvement in response 
 to this specific incident. The ADM-001, DB-001, and MED-001 sources do not indicate any police response, 
 intervention, or presence related to the pig effigy display."

latency_days:
 value: 7
 justification: "ADM-001: \"We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic 
 caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board of Regents 
 meeting on our campus in mid-March. The protest ended on March 21 and the display has been removed.\" 
 The statement from UCLA was dated March 28, 2024, and the protest ended on March 21, 2024. This indicates 
 a 7-day latency between the incident and the administrative response."
 sources: [ADM-001]

administrative_tone:
 value: condemnation
 justification: "ADM-001: \"We are appalled, offended and deeply frustrated by the ugly antisemitic 
 caricature that was displayed as part of a protest targeting a University of California Board of Regents 
 meeting on our campus in mid-March.\" 
 
 ADM-001: \"Hateful and racist depictions like this are a complete affront to UCLA's Principles of Community 
 and True Bruin Values, and to the diverse, inclusive academic community we aim to cultivate.\" 
 
 These quotes use strong language that clearly denounces the display as morally wrong and harmful, fitting 
 the definition of 'condemnation' tone."
 sources: [ADM-001]

administrative_positioning:
 value: civil_rights
 justification: "ADM-001: \"It is absolutely critical that Jewish members of our community — as well as 
 those of all backgrounds and faiths — are treated with respect and dignity. We remain committed to doing 
 all we can to support the safety and protect the rights of everyone on our campus.\" 
 
 This framing emphasizes the university's duty to protect the civil rights and equal treatment of all 
 community members, particularly highlighting respect and dignity for Jewish members alongside others."
 sources: [ADM-001]

media_positioning:
 value: group_targeting
 justification: "MED-001: \"The most recent display of Jew-hatred on a University of California campus 
 speaks volumes to what Jewish and Israeli students are experiencing every day. Students and faculty 
 across California are impacted by this hateful bigotry and it must come to an end.\" 
 
 DB-001: \"So too the juxtaposition between a hand holding a birdcage – presumably to symbolize the lack 
 of freedom of Palestinians – and a hand holding a bag of money triggers alarms for those familiar with 
 the history of antisemitism.\" 
 
 These quotes frame the incident as targeting Jewish students and faculty based on their identity, 
 fitting the 'group_targeting' media positioning."
 sources: [MED-001, DB-001]

actor_tone:
 value: defiant
 justification: "I reviewed the following sources containing actor tone indicators: MED-001.

 Found approximately 3 references to defiant tone (100%), 0 references to other tones (0%).

 Evidence for defiant tone:
 MED-001: \"During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in 
 to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians.\"
 
 MED-001: \"During these 3 days, UC Divest shut it down through various actions such as propping up Tent City, 
 students camping out near Luskin Conference Center, making our presence inescapable to the Regents.\"

 I considered both frequency and intensity by examining the language used to describe the actors' behavior, 
 which suggests deliberate resistance and pushing boundaries by making their presence 'inescapable' and 
 displaying controversial imagery.

 Based on this quantitative analysis, defiant represents 100% of tone references, meeting the 60% threshold 
 for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding is defiant."
 sources: [MED-001]

target_tone:
 value: fear/distress
 justification: "I reviewed the following sources containing target tone indicators: DB-001, MED-001.

 Found approximately 6 references to fear/distress (67%), 3 references to accusatory (33%).

 Evidence for fear/distress:
 MED-001: \"Jewish students 'were very disturbed, upset and concerned' about the pig display.\"
 
 MED-001: \"Jewish students spoke out during public comment, where they denounced the 'growing harassment 
 against faculty and students who support Israel [...] swastikas painted on buildings and signs calling 
 Jews 'the new Nazis.'\"

 Evidence for accusatory:
 DB-001: \"To anyone familiar with classic antisemitic stereotypes, it is impossible not to recoil.\"
 
 DB-001: \"Again, to anyone familiar with the repertoire of antisemitic images, it is hard to regard 
 the assemblage of the pig, bag of money and star of David as anything other than a case of antisemitism 
 that taps into deeply ingrained stereotypes.\"

 I considered both frequency and intensity by examining the emotional content of the responses, where 
 the targets' expressions of feeling "disturbed," "upset," and "concerned" convey direct emotional distress, 
 while the accusatory elements focus more on analysis of the imagery.

 Based on this quantitative analysis, fear/distress represents 67% of tone references, meeting the 60% 
 threshold for predominant tone. Therefore, the appropriate coding is fear/distress."

actor_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: "MED-001: \"A pro-Palestinian student urged the UC Regents to divest 'from firms that 
 support the 'ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing' of Palestinians,' per the Times.\" 
 
 MED-001: \"During March 19-21, students and community from four UC campuses carried out a 3 day sit-in 
 to demand the UC regents divest from war and the genocide of Palestinians.\" 
 
 These quotes show the actors framing their protest around moral rights and freedoms for Palestinians, 
 positioning their actions as defending the rights of an oppressed group."
 sources: [MED-001]

target_positioning:
 value: rights-based
 justification: "DB-001: \"It is possible to acknowledge both – and to support the long-deferred right 
 to self-determination of Palestinians and the right of Jews to live in peace and security in the land 
 they inhabit.\" 
 
 MED-001: \"We ask the Regents to speak up and denounce this antisemitic display and make clear that 
 there is no tolerance for antisemitism on University campuses. Their silence on this issue is complicity.\" 
 
 These quotes indicate that the targets are framing the incident in terms of civil rights and fair treatment, 
 focusing on their right to exist without discrimination or antisemitism on campus."
 sources: [DB-001, MED-001]

notes:
 value: "On March 20-21, 2024, during a UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA, protesters displayed a 
 statue depicting a pig with a Star of David container, holding a money bag and birdcage with keffiyeh. 
 The university and Jewish community members condemned it as antisemitic, citing historical stereotypes 
 associating Jews with pigs and money. UCLA issued a statement condemning the display on March 28. 
 The protest was organized by pro-Palestinian students advocating for divestment from companies linked to Israel."
