# UCLA Incident Analysis: Categorized Thought Atoms
# Preserving exact wording and sequential numbering across categories

## UNIVERSAL (Spans All Phases)

### Core Themes & Definitions

thought_001: "Words matter. They are 'actionable,' even if standard legal proceedings might only recognize 'inaction,' in this day and age, with lies, spin, and social media, institutions have a new responsibility to adhere to responsible messaging."

thought_002: "There are tens of thousands of undergraduate students and hundreds of thousands in the greater community. Decisions cannot be ad hoc, especially in this day and age, when we have valuable policy and data-driven information. These are not trivial matters relating to a local high school pep rally"

thought_005: "A key theme is deliberate indifference"

### Key Questions

thought_006: "If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite 'Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid' instead of saying, 'this was an unlawful obstruction'?" The issue is, when violence was happening from counter-protesters, they never mentioned any student feeling "threatened and afraid." They simply took administrative steps (such as increasing police presence). In this case, Block's statement says they removed the barriers. Yet rather than call it a violation of TPM, he adds a layer of emotional harm. It means that he himself does believe that words matter, that perpetrators of unlawful acts need to be addressed, but only in some cases. 

thought_007: "Why didn't Block cite the rules that were broken and state an actionable path to either ensure the encampment was functioning in line with campus policy or to disperse and shut it down entirely?"

thought_010: "Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways and violence) to continue for days before acting? Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful? 

thought_012: "UCLA cited Jewish students' safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampmentâ€”despite not acting on the same concerns earlier."

thought_013: "What does it mean to 'feel unsafe?'"

thought_014: "I want to frame the reader's mindset so that by the time they reach the riot, they fully grasp the institutional failures that led to it."

### UCLA Policy & Approach

thought_016: "separate factions became so inflamed, that a sequence of events set off a premeditated act of domestic terrorism"

thought_017: "the counter-protesters planned the ambush on the encampment on the evening of April 30th in advance"

thought_018: "there is proof from words spoken by counter-protesters that evening that they were reacting directly to Chancellor Block's statement"

thought_020: "Policing has always been a 'point and shoot' tool, they never expected UCPD to handle policy. They did when riots broke out"

thought_023: "If people are violently harassed and/or sent to the hospital as a result of failures of UCLA policy, they are being denied access to their education"


### Media & Community Influence

thought_026: "They're aware of misinformation spreading through the community -> posts on Twitter and death threats to English Dept."

thought_027: "They're aware of the vast Jewish and pro-Israel connection with UCLA social media channels -> UCLA even posted ahead of the meeting to try to dispel rumors"

thought_028: "Even despite their best efforts to address 'rumors' that did not change the violent outcome"

thought_029: "It was the English Dept that opted to use an abundance of caution and move the teach in"

thought_030: "They witnessed the effect -> violence shown to students, and one parent"

thought_031: "Their solution to the Kaplan incident had nothing to do with holding perpetrators accountable"

thought_032: "Encampment communication's influence by media and the community was confirmed by the 21 solutions independent report"

thought_033: "reaction to encampment conduct made publicly, and directed at students. reaction to pinata incident made publicly and directed at students. reaction to pig effigy made publicly and directed at students. at no point was there ever an explicit reaction to counterprotesters, either after the kaplan event, or during the April protest"

thought_039: "one-sided coverage serves to shape the public perception that only antisemitic incidents are happening"

### Free Speech & Legal Framework

thought_040: "The rules around free speech are fear-agnostic. If rules are broken the violation must be cited explicitly. It is incumbent on the administration to separately address and ameliorate fear that stems from rhetoric, activity, or incidents on campus. In other words: 1. By totality of circumstances, does the fear meet the Title VI harassment and discrimination standard such that the behavior in question is no longer protected by 1A? Or 2. Should it not be a policy of the administration to *consistently* address incidents that may inflame tensions or impact student morale? Why when CAC and USAC were partaking in speech that clearly upset Jewish students, did the university not move to address student concerns? And why when CAC and USAC were in breach of campus policy, did the university not immediately state the policy violation and put an end to the offending behavior?"

thought_042: "these universities owe it to the students to stop having bank presidents in charge of messaging. seriously how could the school even function without undergraduate students paying tuition? they are taking them for granted."

thought_043: "As the oversight body and mediator, the lack of action taken by the university resulted in inflamed tensions between students. The incorrect action was then taken when tensions were high, leading to unsafe conditions and violence."

thought_044: "What is the real fear here? That free speech be truly allowed on campus? Or that there is some level of harmony on campus should the rules be carried out as intended? Is that the fear, the implications of a properly functioning campus? It is not the responsibility of the administration to manufacture hostility on false pretenses. If this is the state of the world, let them learn it there. Unless it is their intention to release hostile individuals on an already disharmonious world, such that the US foreign policy and the goepolitical state of this world remains the same."

thought_047: "Myers wrote an article about the warring sides in forward (he mentioned something about the language they were speaking). These are foreigners, putting foreign interests above our own, how long will we let this go on?"

## PRE-ENCAMPMENT

### CAC & USAC Issues

thought_049: "They were allowing CAC and Verdugo (via Tsives and Shapiro) to be the face of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus. Despite the fact the group should have been condemned on numerous occasions and eventually shut down completely"

thought_051: "When USAC began excluding it was clear they were compromised. Jewish students called out the exclusion (winter). 

thought_053: "It goes against school policy to exclude"

thought_054: "Jewish students pay student fees, USAC uses these fees"

thought_055: "Evidence against (CAC) continued to pile up, how much needed to accumulate? (flashback to post-Oct 7th incident): Jewish students had to take it upon themselves; but they called for her impeachment earlier (petition)."

thought_056: "USAC used to condemn antisemitic incidents around the country and the world but based on no condemnations by USAC for any antisemitic behavior on campus, or for blockading or any behavior breaking the rules, it was clear they weren't going to address issues"

thought_062: "Jewish students didn't manage to begin the hearing process until the following academic year, after Verdugo had been voted in again by the student body. Jewish students don't even have the representation necessary to change voting outcomes. Why are such extreme measures necessary when behavior is clearly violating policy?"

thought_065: "The university didn't bother to weed out bad apples, which served to inflame tensions between student factions (Eli Tsives, who mentioned Verdugo by name)"

thought_066: "While at the same time, before the riots, no counterprotesters were addressed"

thought_067: "CAC had been a major problem all year (even to get Shapiro's attention), potentially a major contributor to tensions between students, yet the school did nothing to stop them or address student concerns (who honestly cares about dialogue across differences if they can't stop the discrimination (and violence) happening that goes against policy first?). The moment CAC entered the encampment (student funds) that raises eyebrows because there was clear discrimination happening from them (at this point they're crossing the line into pervasive). The moment the encampment started blockading, and CAC was a part of it (the students pay student fees) Verdugo is out."

thought_068: "All the money they spend on artillery against the students needs to go to processing reports, generating messaging, and enforcing rules."

### Early Incident Response Failures

thought_071: "Along with zero statements made about Kaplan the incident, there were also no statements made about tracking down the perpetrators. When the Bruin inquired directly, a low-level administrator answered. The student said herself she saw one of them at a pro-Israel vigil at around 7 pm. How would it feel to know that masked assailants who may have ID'd a student were now free to attend campus events and be on campus at any time?"

## ENCAMPMENT

### Communication & Warning Failures

thought_081: "they did not choose to publicly address the encampment, however the encampment did publicly respond"

thought_082: "Block claimed it was due to security issues (congressional hearing), that's why he wanted to shut it down that day, but he never stated that to the students, and never bothered to warn them when they released the statement that they would stay"

thought_083: "there's also a video capture of someone saying 'this is for blocking students and making them afraid' (reddit)"

thought_085: "Block sent a campus-wide statement saying that the encampment made students feel threatened and afraid"

thought_086: "Block told the House Committee that security issues were why they cleared the encampment"

thought_087: "At no point was there a public, campus-wide notice addressing protesting students for the purposes of danger mitigation. Because the message was not campus-wide, only a subset of students were guaranteed to have received it"

thought_089: "There was an unclear message in the form of a flyer that students needed to leave"

thought_090: "There was no clear message that students were engaging in unlawful obstruction or were in immediate danger"


### Messaging Problems

thought_092: "Block's message was, 'however one feels about the encampment'. How is this a content-neutral approach? Rhetoric was totally absent except for this."

thought_093: It is odd that April 29th there was all that violence, then on April 30th they condemned the encampment, attempted to shut it down, but did not mention at all that there was a security threat. There was vague reasoning on a flyer relating to rules violations, there was no good faith messaging that the welfare of the students was at risk. 

thought_099: "Block needed to take a position and choose rhetoric that would be **sure to ensure the safety of the largest number of students**. A very large number of students were feeling threatened and afraid at that point, including protesters that may or may not have been partaking in the blockading. **The only way** to ensure the safety of the largest number of students, would have been to issue a clear and immediate dispersal order to the encampment."

### Policy Enforcement Failures

thought_102: "Why didn't they assist in ensuring areas of campus were not blocked? Did they care about clearing walkways for Jewish students and subjecting blockading students to student conduct hearings? If no, then did they care to notify the encampment of its unlawful obstruction? If no, then did they care to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful? The university was content with allowing the blockading to go on for days, with no response. During which time harassment by counter-protesters was becoming increasingly worse. The university's only official response was to shut the protest down using a confusing flyer and rhetoric that was sure to inflame already increasing tensions"

thought_111: "The Bruin stated that the Block had never called the encampment unlawful before"

### Deliberate Indifference During Encampment

thought_115: "Students groups responded by saying 'we will not leave'"

thought_116: "It should have been clear to UCLA (via constructive notice) that the encampment would not be vacated that evening"

thought_117: "If they had really intended on having the encampment cleared, and they knew that it would not be, why not take further administrative or security steps to address the encampment? Because they chose deliberate indifference to the situation. They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the status of their own students. They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the lack of police presence and backup that would be available to them. Did they indicate to John Thomas, who was watching a Dodgers game that evening, that they'd sent a message to the greater community saying Jewish students were feeling threatened and afraid? That the protesting students responded by saying they will not leave? And that given the chance of a coordinated response by counterprotesters, that he should be prepared for violence in large numbers?"

thought_118: "knowing that "rumors" can circulate and reactions can get out of hand, why did UCLA not address the blockading allegations saying they were addressing the situation and had it under control? Why instead did they throw fuel on the fire?""

## POST-ENCAMPMENT

### Arrest & Notification Issues

thought_126: "There was no clear message that continuing to camp on university grounds would result in arrest"

thought_127: "Students within the encampment were told the afternoon before, in-person (by Hunt?)"

thought_128: "The encampment was ambushed in the middle of the night. Did all students in the encampment have adequate warning to leave or be arrested? (Kersten said in the lawsuit that he left because they were threatening arrest so maybe they did have more warning than a dispersal order in the middle of the night)."

### Accountability Failures

thought_130: "After the riots, the university chose to single out and pursue charges against specific rioters (who social media and CNN made the effort to ID). Even then, with ample video footage, charges against the hoodie guy could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (his charges were lowered to misdemeanor I think, need to follow up on that). That amounts to approximately five people, out of hundreds who showed up with weapons, fireworks, and contributed to violence and harassment. Counterprotesters were so numerous that the police would not even engage with them for hours."

thought_133: "Did all protesting students have this coming?"

thought_134: "The person's quote saying that the encampment 'had it coming'"

### Ongoing Safety & Trust Issues

thought_139: "It might not be up to the administration to "sane wash" the movement, but if they genuinely care about the welfare of targeted students (on both sides), they would address issues as they arise (on both sides). Title VI and that policy doc encourage UCLA's input to the marketplace of ideas"

### Research Framework

thought_165: "Testing whether severity, visibility, or group identity best predicts institutional action"

thought_168: "Follow the visibility. who is responsible for some of that visibility? who is unwilling to be held accountable for the consequences of doing so?" (find who the LA times attributed the extreme reaction to, they followed the narrative of some guy who'd heard about things on his group chat). 

thought_169: "Even if ucla were not directly responsible for the huge response, they should have known that social media could contribute to a riot. Even IF the words spoken to protesters by other demonstrators or counterprotesters were not direct and imminent threates or "fighting words," (if the university deemed it free speech) they were severe enough in nature to warrant extreme caution about the plausibility that violence could break out on a massive scale"

thought_172: "the marketplace of ideas, who is trying (which Jewish group) is trying to 'control the narrative' and which is arguing against exclusion in good faith? Is it possible there is rhetorical divergence at least with respect to chilling free speech (everyone including Hillel is entitled to their opinion, if they want to fight pro-palestinian speech, so be it. the question is, did they want to shut down free speech?) were they proponents of rules that facilitated heckler's vetos and violence? or were they simply putting their own political hat and at times condemnation of pro-palestinian groups into the ring?"

thought_177: "sams report and the 21 solutions statement about sams not being adequate overlap"

thought_179: "why is dialog across differences and not condemnation the way to handle these incidents (see icloud/records_requests). like every rhetorical statement, they were talking to students and these people are not students! They even revitalized dialogue across differences (under a new name) the following year"

thought_184: "Would it have helped John Thomas to know that there were issues ongoing for a long period of time? Because if the police response needs to be of a certain 'size,' the size requirements are always met when facing the students, yet were not met when facing outside assailants. Was he aware that these people posed an ongoing threat to students?"

thought_185: "the solution to unrest was upping security, spending tons of money, chilling free speech. but even then there were issues with bias (June 10th)"

thought_187: "the jewish is always the visible stuff so that's what the school caters to, they're acting like a business, this is a matter of stakeholders, community, and jewish-centered media. many stakeholders withdrew funding to the school"
