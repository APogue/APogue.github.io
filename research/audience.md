## The Approach
[4 key innovations, maybe with icon fonts or emoji]
- 📊 Structured Evidence Collection: Every incident coded using 20+ variables
- 🔍 Source-Traceable Analysis: All claims linked to specific documents
- 🤖 AI-Assisted Consistency: Using Claude API to scale rigorous coding protocols
- 📂 Open Methodology: Replicable framework others can adapt



FAQ (short)

Is this advocacy?No. It’s a neutral, rule‑based audit method. Findings are limited to the documented corpus and time window.

Why keep the full codebook private now?To prevent misuse and preserve integrity while thresholds are still being validated. The plan is to open it post‑validation.

What counts as evidence?Official statements, policy text, timestamped reporting, and defined org posts—each referenced directly in YAML outputs.

### Building Tools for Institutional Accountability
A transparent framework for detecting bias in institutional oversight

2.	Before/After Comparison:
	- Before: “Anecdotal complaints, years later”
	- After: “Systematic evidence, real-time”
3.	The Problem/Solution Visual:
    - Show chaos/unclear responses → organized/transparent analysis

### For Researchers
Interested in adapting this framework for your institution? The methodology is designed for replication. Contact me to discuss implementation or to access redacted methodology documents.

### For Participants
If you have direct experience with the incidents being studied, your perspective adds crucial context to the coded data. Interviews help bridge the gap between structural analysis and lived experience.

### For Collaborators
This framework benefits from interdisciplinary review. Whether you work in data science, policy analysis, civil rights, or institutional governance, your expertise can strengthen this methodology.
