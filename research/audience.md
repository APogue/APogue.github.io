## For Participants

This project seeks to document what UCLA did — or did not do — after students reported identity-based harm and protest-related harassment. Because administrative records are incomplete, first-hand accounts are critical.

### What We’re Asking
- **Reports filed**: Did you submit an EDI complaint, Title VI report, police report, or Dean of Students complaint?  
- **Acknowledgment**: Did you receive a confirmation or case number?  
- **Follow-up**: Did anyone from UCLA contact you, interview you, or provide an outcome letter?  
- **Remedial steps**: Were you offered any safety measures, academic adjustments, or supportive services?   

### What We’re Not Asking (in this phase)
- We are not asking about how hostile the environment felt, or personal perceptions of climate.  
- The focus is solely on **documented steps UCLA took (or failed to take)** once students came forward.  

### Why This Matters
Title VI requires UCLA to take prompt and effective steps to alleviate a hostile environment. First-hand accounts help establish whether those steps were taken.  

### Confidentiality
- You may share anonymously or on the record.  
- Information will only be published with your consent, and raw materials will be handled securely.

## The Approach
[4 key innovations, maybe with icon fonts or emoji]
- 📊 Structured Evidence Collection: Every incident coded using 20+ variables
- 🔍 Source-Traceable Analysis: All claims linked to specific documents
- 🤖 AI-Assisted Consistency: Using Claude API to scale rigorous coding protocols
- 📂 Open Methodology: Replicable framework others can adapt



FAQ (short)

Is this advocacy?No. It’s a neutral, rule‑based audit method. Findings are limited to the documented corpus and time window.

Why keep the full codebook private now?To prevent misuse and preserve integrity while thresholds are still being validated. The plan is to open it post‑validation.

What counts as evidence?Official statements, policy text, timestamped reporting, and defined org posts—each referenced directly in YAML outputs.

### Building Tools for Institutional Accountability
A transparent framework for detecting bias in institutional oversight

	- Before: “Anecdotal complaints, years later”
	- After: “Systematic evidence, real-time”
3.	The Problem/Solution Visual:
    - Show chaos/unclear responses → organized/transparent analysis

### For Participants
If you have direct experience with the incidents being studied, your perspective adds crucial context to the coded data. Interviews help bridge the gap between structural analysis and lived experience.

### For Collaborators
This framework benefits from interdisciplinary review. Whether you work in data science, policy analysis, civil rights, or institutional governance, your expertise can strengthen this methodology.
