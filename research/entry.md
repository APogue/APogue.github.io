**Stage 1 — Incident Discovery**  
- Daily Bruin scrape (inclusion rule)  
- Defines what counts as an incident  

**Stage 2 — Evidence Blocks**  
- Public Admin Comms — chancellor emails, statements  
- Internal Comms — administrator emails, planning docs  
- 3rd Party Reports — task force, commissioned reviews  
- Policy & Legal Framework — UC policy, Title VI, First Amendment  
- Police Reports — UCPD logs, arrests  
- **First-Hand Accounts (current focus)**  
  - Student/faculty filings (EDI, Title VI, Dean of Students, UCPD)  
  - Acknowledgments, follow-ups, remedial offers  
  - Incident video footage, SAMS reports  

**Stage 3 — Coding Layer**  
- Apply structured variables  
- Values = rule-based + evidence citations  
- Human oversight checks

**Stage 4 — Comparative Tests**  
- Cross-group disparity (identity vs. response)  
- Within-group drivers (identity held constant, check severity/visibility)

## Methods 

This project evaluates how UCLA responded to identity-based harm and protest-related incidents and whether those responses aligned with policy and legal obligations.

### Evidence Sources
1. **Public Administrative Communication**  
   - Chancellor and administrative statements, press releases, campuswide emails.  
   - Purpose: Measure tone, framing, and timing of responses.  

2. **Internal Communication**  
   - External communications to administrators, internal administrator emails, outgoing administrator communications.  
   - Purpose: Compare what administrators knew vs. what was stated publicly. Compare how administrators planned to respond to incidents vs. what administrative actions occurred.  

3. **Independent/3rd Party Reports**  
   - Commissioned investigations, task force reviews, consultant reports.  
   - Purpose: Establish how risks and responses were externally evaluated.  

4. **Policy & Legal Framework**  
   - UC policy, First Amendment principles, Title VI obligations, USAC rules.  
   - Purpose: Benchmark UCLA’s obligations against actual practice.  

5. **Police Reports**  
   - UCPD incident reports, crime logs, arrest data.  
   - Purpose: Identify how incidents were recorded, investigated, or closed.  

6. **First-Hand Accounts (Critical Evidence Gap Filler)**  
   - Because PRA/FOIA requests can produce limited records, first-hand accounts are essential to establish what reports were filed and how UCLA responded.  
   - Scope: Not general perceptions of climate, but **factual details of process**:  
     - Who filed reports (EDI, Title VI, Dean of Students, UCPD).  
     - What acknowledgment, follow-up, or closure notices were received.  
     - What (if any) protective or remedial measures UCLA offered.  
   - Purpose: To verify whether UCLA fulfilled its Title VI duty to alleviate a hostile environment once on notice of identity-based exclusion or harassment.
