### 🔍 Explore the Pipeline  
**When the record stops, the questions start.**

---

#### **Step 1: Source-Based Structuring**
📄 **Source Documents → 🧠 Structured Output**  
Claude codes each variable using official sources — articles, policies, statements — with traceable logic.

> *If a variable can’t be resolved from the record...*

---

#### **Step 2: Gap Detection**
❓ **Information Gap → 🔍 Investigative Escalation**  
The system flags where the evidence ends — missing follow-through, unclear enforcement, or institutional silence.

> *When documentation fails to answer a key question...*

---

#### **Step 3: External Outreach**
📂 **→ FOIA / Public Records Requests**  
💬 **→ Request for Institutional Comment**  
🎤 **→ Interviews With Involved Parties**  

When documents go silent, the pipeline continues — through structured outreach and testimony designed to fill the gap.

---

> **Every interview is tied to the question that prompted it. Every step stays on record.**
