## Methods 




This project evaluates how UCLA responded to protest-related incidents and whether those responses aligned with policy and legal obligations.

### Evidence Sources
1. **Public Administrative Communication**  
   - Chancellor and administrative statements, press releases, campuswide emails.  
   - Purpose: Measure tone, framing, and timing of responses.  

2. **Internal Communication**  
   - External communications to administrators, internal administrator emails, outgoing administrator communications.  
   - Purpose: Compare what administrators knew vs. what was stated publically. Compare how administrators planned to respond to incidents vs. what administrative actions occurred.  

3. **Independent/3rd Party Reports**  
   - Commissioned investigations, task force reviews, consultant reports.  
   - Purpose: Establish how risks and responses were externally evaluated.  

4. **Policy & Legal Framework**  
   - UC policy (time, place, manner rules), First Amendment principles, Title VI obligations, USAC rules.  
   - Purpose: Benchmark UCLAâ€™s obligations against actual practice.  

5. **Police Reports**  
   - UCPD incident reports, crime logs, arrest data.  
   - Purpose: Identify how incidents were recorded, investigated, or closed.  

6. **First-Hand Accounts (Critical Evidence Gap Filler)**  
   - Because PRA/FOIA requests can produce limited records, first-hand accounts are essential to establish what reports were filed and how UCLA responded.  
   - Scope: Not general perceptions of climate, but **factual details of process**:  
     - Who filed reports (EDI, Title VI, Dean of Students, UCPD).  
     - What acknowledgment, follow-up, or closure notices were received.  
     - What (if any) protective or remedial measures UCLA offered.  
   - Purpose: To verify whether UCLA fulfilled its Title VI duty to alleviate a hostile environment once on notice of identity-based exclusion or harassment.
