### Demographic research

- [Undergraduate Admissions Summary Tables](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/admissions-residency-and-ethnicity)

- [Accountability report 2020](https://accountability.universityofcalifornia.edu/2020/chapters/chapter-7.html#7.3.1)

    - "African American students are less likely to feel that students of their race/ethnicity are respected on their campus than other students."

    - "Conservative undergraduates are less likely to feel that students of their political affiliation are respected on campus than those with liberal or moderate political opinions."

    - "The share of students who felt their religion was respected increased between 2016 and 2018, particularly for Muslim students."

    - There is no data on the URM categories in STEM fields

    - What about STEM and socioeconomic status? 

- [Executive Summary](https://accountability.universityofcalifornia.edu/2020/exec-sum.html)

    - Public high schools and UC student and faculty, percent female

    - Public high schools and UC student and faculty, percent underrepresented

- [UCOP Academic Affairs](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-affairs/prop-209/index.html#:~:text=Proposition%20209%2C%20passed%20in%201996,public%20contracting%20and%20public%20education.) research and analyses on the impact of proposition 209 in CA 


- [AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, MISMATCH, AND ECONOMIC
MOBILITY AFTER CALIFORNIA’S PROPOSITION 209](https://zacharybleemer.com/wp-content/uploads/Papers/QJE%20Affirmative%20Action.pdf)

    - "First, I show that ending AA caused substantial and persistent educational and labor market deterioration among URM UC applicants: each of UC's 10,000 annual URM freshman applicants' likelihood of earning a Bachelor's degree declined by 1.3 percentage points, their likelihood of earning any graduate degree declined 1.4 p.p., and their likelihood of earning at least $100,000 in each year between ages 30 and 37 declined by about 1 p.p. per year. These results imply that affirmative action's end decreased the number of age 30-to-34 URM Californians earning over $100,000 by at least 2.5 percent. Second, I show that ending AA did not improve URM students' relative performance or persistence in core physical, biological, or mathematical science courses, within or across impacted universities. These findings suggest that state prohibitions on university affirmative action policies have modestly exacerbated American socioeconomic inequities."
