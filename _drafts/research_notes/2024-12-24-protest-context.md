	- "At 8:04 p.m., Betar – a self-described national Zionist organization – emailed a statement to the Daily Bruin calling for police to take action against the pro-Palestine protesters and criticizing UCLA’s approach to policing. They added in the statement that they were willing to pay legal fees for pro-Israel counter-protesters who “make it uncomfortable” for those inside the sukkah encampment.

		“We demand police remove these thugs now and if not we will be forced to organize groups of Jews to do so,” they said in the statement. “We urge all Jews to go directly to this area and do not appease those who say stay away.”

		Minutes later, around 30 pro-Israel protesters arrived outside the sukkah, attempting to enter the temporary structure that had been set up. Many of the pro-Israel protesters also heckled sukkah participants, including by calling them “terrorists.”

		At 8:22 p.m., around 50 UCPD officers wearing riot gear arrived in Dickson Court North, surrounding the sukkah encampment and instructing protesters to disperse. According to a post from UCPD on the social platform X, officers announced a dispersal order just after 8:30 p.m., after which most pro-Palestine protesters left the area.

		In response, pro-Israel protesters cheered and shouted, “We love you, LAPD.” The Daily Bruin was unable to confirm the presence of any LAPD officers on campus Monday.

		“One person was arrested tonight for failure to disperse at Dickson Court North following a dispersal order for an unauthorized demonstration involving about 40 people,” UCPD said in a statement posted on X at 9:58 p.m. Monday. “The area is now clear.”"

	- "WHEREAS, Muslim women were verbally harassed and physically assaulted on November 6th by individuals protesting the NJSP conference and have received minimal support from the university regarding the instance;"

	- "WHEREAS, UCLA students and faculty members wrote to Chancellor Block to “firmly advise
		UCLA to refrain from intervening against the planned NSJP conference and to take
		extraordinary measure to protect attendees.”11;"

	- "LET IT BE RESOLVED, The Undergraduate Student Association council of UCLA recognizes and condemns the threats and harm that students have faced from external forces for expressing their protected constitutional rights."

	- "LET IT BE FURTHER RESOLVED That the USAC commends the pre-existence of a Jewish Caucus within NSJP but recognizes that inclusion of the Jewish community and condemnation of anti-Semitism amongst registered conference attendees must be ongoing; "

	"In light of the resolution passed by the Los Angeles City Council as well as the verbal and physical attacks on undergraduate Muslim students on campus this week, we — as both Jewish and non-Jewish students and faculty of UCLA — are writing to firmly advise UCLA to refrain from intervening against the planned NSJP conference at UCLA.

	Additionally, in light of the Yad Yamin protest on November 6, we seriously urge the University to take extraordinary measures to protect the safety of conference attendees. The safety of students must be prioritized over dangerous political stunts. We must agree with City Councilman Paul Koretz (https://bit.ly/2RCES1Y)) that “our campuses should never become an environment where students of any origin are harassed, bullied, or prohibited from learning.” Given the ongoing harassment of Muslim students on our campus by outside groups and individuals, the safety of Muslim students attending the conference is a grave and critical concern." 

- [Op-Ed: The controversial Students for Justice in Palestine conference will go on at UCLA. Here’s why](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-block-ucla-students-for-justice-in-palestine-conference-20181112-story.html)

	"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been among the most volatile issues at UCLA, but that volatility cannot prevent us from addressing it."

	"Some students, community members and even the Los Angeles City Council, concerned by anti-Semitic statements made by some SJP members around the country, have demanded that UCLA cancel the event."

	"On both routine academic matters and controversial issues, the overwhelming majority of university leaders — and that includes me — strive to preserve the rights of all sides to speak and be heard. At the same time, we recognize the often existential impact of emotionally charged debates about issues like the Mideast conflict, immigration, affirmative action and abortion. Preserving the right to speak about such issues does not validate the content of that speech. All too often affording a group their constitutional rights is falsely perceived as an institutional endorsement of their message."

	"It remains an awkward reality that our constitutional system, and democracy’s commitment to open debate, demand that Americans allow speech we may oppose."

	"When SJP announced its intention to hold its national conference at UCLA, the university recognized its legal right to do so. Much of what will be said at that conference may be deeply objectionable — even personally hurtful — to those who believe that a complex conflict is being reduced to a one-sided caricature, or see a double standard that demonizes the world’s only Jewish state while other countries receive less condemnation for dreadful behavior. Indeed, there is fear among some that the conference will be infused with anti-Semitic rhetoric."

- [various counter-protestor assailants have been outed by CNN](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ct6cnu/various_counterprotestor_assailants_have_been/)

	- [reddit profile of a CNN source](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kahzgul/)

		- CNN didn't run a news story announcing their investigation either; they investigated, and then they ran a news story. As part of that investigation, they reached out to people who were collecting information, and then they corroborated that information. I was one of those people. No one from any law enforcement agency has reached out to me or any of my contacts. Which is to say that law enforcement is not investigating as rigorously as CNN did.

- [Why far-right groups are disrupting US campus protests: ‘When there’s so much attention, they show up’](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/10/college-campus-protests-far-right)

	"RG Cravens, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, has tracked the Leave Our Kids Alone protests since they began disrupting school board meetings last summer and threw their weight behind a controversial anti-trans statewide ballot measure.

	The reason these counter-demonstrators are drawn to protests over the war in the Middle East, he said, was that they see them through the prism of a broader rightwing view that “traditional” societies and families are under threat. “Their animosity towards the campus demonstrations are part of this Christian far-right perspective that LGBTQ folks are threats to Christianity, and so are Palestinians or Muslims,” Cravens said."
