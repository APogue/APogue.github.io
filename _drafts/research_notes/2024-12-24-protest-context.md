	- "At 8:04 p.m., Betar – a self-described national Zionist organization – emailed a statement to the Daily Bruin calling for police to take action against the pro-Palestine protesters and criticizing UCLA’s approach to policing. They added in the statement that they were willing to pay legal fees for pro-Israel counter-protesters who “make it uncomfortable” for those inside the sukkah encampment.

		“We demand police remove these thugs now and if not we will be forced to organize groups of Jews to do so,” they said in the statement. “We urge all Jews to go directly to this area and do not appease those who say stay away.”

		Minutes later, around 30 pro-Israel protesters arrived outside the sukkah, attempting to enter the temporary structure that had been set up. Many of the pro-Israel protesters also heckled sukkah participants, including by calling them “terrorists.”

		At 8:22 p.m., around 50 UCPD officers wearing riot gear arrived in Dickson Court North, surrounding the sukkah encampment and instructing protesters to disperse. According to a post from UCPD on the social platform X, officers announced a dispersal order just after 8:30 p.m., after which most pro-Palestine protesters left the area.

		In response, pro-Israel protesters cheered and shouted, “We love you, LAPD.” The Daily Bruin was unable to confirm the presence of any LAPD officers on campus Monday.

		“One person was arrested tonight for failure to disperse at Dickson Court North following a dispersal order for an unauthorized demonstration involving about 40 people,” UCPD said in a statement posted on X at 9:58 p.m. Monday. “The area is now clear.”"

## Professor takes

- [UCLA’s Unholy Alliance](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/uclas-unholy-alliance/)

This was written by Robin D.G. Kelley

"Immediately after the story began circulating on social media, the Los Angeles Times interviewed the woman in question who explained that she had been accidentally shoved by a fellow counterprotester “while attempting to retrieve her fallen [Israeli] flag.”" This is not what the LA Times was doing. 

"The woman told The Times she had been shoved to the ground by another demonstrator while attempting to retrieve her fallen flag."

By using neutral language ("another demonstrator"), they distance themselves from confirming the Instagram account’s claim that a group of pro-Palestinian protesters committed a targeted assault.

Soft Correction? The LA Times may be subtly pushing back against the Instagram post’s framing but without outright calling it misinformation.

Other articles written by David Myers located in Protest activities- UCLA handling and Protest activities- students and faculty voice concerns.

"The problem is, it wasn’t true. All buildings and classrooms remained accessible. Campus security closed off particular entrances to buildings facing the quad, but that decision was authorized by the administration. Student-appointed security leads asked passers-by to go around the encampment in order to limit congestion and the risk of Covid infection (masks were required).” 

This is corroborated by Reddit. Obviously they can't blockade any areas of campus. But they weren't literally denied access to any buildings. 

"Our suspicions were confirmed when, shortly after issuing his statement, he announced plans to clear the encampment by 6:00 p.m. that day. The timing is important: UC Divest and SJP were scheduled to begin negotiations with Hunt at 4:00 p.m. The meeting was doomed to fail, in part because the administration did not try to negotiate in good faith and gave students no time to recover from the horrific violence they had suffered just hours before."

**How was the clearing of the encampment announced?** Check the lawsuit but also ask. 

He goes on to say that nonlethal force was used to clear the encampment. Why so much money spent for nonlethal force, and it is never used on anyone but students? 

"That night Zionist agitators, alongside neo-Nazis, came armed with bear mace and other chemical irritants, hammers, knives, stink bombs, high-grade fireworks, metal and wooden rods, and, according to some reports, a gun. The attack began with loud recordings of screaming babies, followed by a fusillade of fireworks shot directly into the encampment. Men in full-faced white masks broke down the barriers and began attacking students with metal rods, chunks of wood, stink bombs, bear mace and tear gas. One student recalled seeing “planks of wood come sailing into the camp and strike some girl in the back of the head and she just fell to the ground.” Another student was struck in the back of the head by fireworks and had to be hospitalized. The medics were simply overwhelmed, forcing students with little experience to attend to wounds. “People were crying and being like, ‘Can you call my mom, I need to call my mom, please help me’. . . . We were trying to do the best that we could but we ran out of saline needed to flush the chemicals out of people’s eyes,” one told me."

This proves it was a coordinated attack, it was premeditated, planned, and executed. 

"One student was rushed to the hospital by his classmates after being struck twice in the head. His injuries were serious enough to require stitches and staples. “I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,” the student recalled. “The only thing that kept me moving forward was my . . . classmates who were brave enough to protect the encampment from these terrorists.”"

"UCLA alumnus Ismael Sindha, who was later treated for chemical burns, heard attackers shout, “I’ll kill you,” “I’ll rape your sister,” and “What Israel does to Gaza, we’ll do to you.”"

"in the wee hours of May 1, four student journalists with the Daily Bruin were tracked down, maced, and severely beaten by members of the mob —sending one, Catherine Hamilton, to the hospital."

"One inebriated agitator harassed several Black women and femmes working security, calling them “slaves” and threatening rape. Later that night, several agitators broke through the encampment barriers and attacked students and pepper sprayed one of the security guards hired by UCLA."

"On April 25 a man walked through the encampment carrying a sign that read “Israel is not apartheid. Come talk,” and proceeded to steal a student’s keffiyeh, pour water over chalk art, and assault a Black woman who tried to take his sign."

"They were pushed, punched, spat upon, called “dogs,” “whores” (sharmuta in Hebrew), “bitch-ass n—,” and told to “listen to your master” and that “Hamas would rape and murder you for what you’re wearing, sweetheart.” One agitator shouted, “We’re not American Jews! We’re Israelis! You stand up against us, we’ll fucking slit your throat.” The attacks continued well into the night. At around 1:30 a.m. someone emptied a backpack full of mice injected with an unknown substance into the encampment."

"In yet another statement, issued on May 1, Block condemned the attacks, acknowledged the trauma our students experienced, and expressed “sympathy” for those injured. He called for an investigation, urging “those who have experienced violence to report what they encountered to UCPD, and those who have faced discrimination to contact the Civil Rights Office.”"

There were never preventative measures. The office of campus safety is an expensive and a disproportionately one-sided deterrent.

The scale for measuring student distress and anxiety must be absolute---one group felt "threatened and afraid" by the actions of the encampment, another dealt with threats and fear in many possible ways. The threatening actions must be dealt with, equally. 

## NSJP Conference in 2018

"Student council remained a contested terrain over Israel and divestment. In 2015 three students unaffiliated with SJP questioned Rachel Beyda, a nominee for USAC’s Judicial Board, about her ability to remain objective on the “Israeli-Palestinian conflict” because of her Jewish identity. Foxx resurrects this incident as evidence of USAC’s “deeply concerning history of retribution against students who speak against anti-Jewish bigotry on campus.” What she omits from the story is that the students who opened the line of questioning were swiftly censured and offered apologies, and that Beyda was unanimously appointed to the committee. SJP also condemned “the questioning of Beyda or anyone else based on their identity,” adding that its members “believe in the inherent equality and right to freedom for all people, a stance that inspires us to both support the Palestinian call for BDS as well as to oppose incidents like that which befell Beyda.”"

Was anything CAC or USAC did, or refused to censure, a egregious? (not rhetorical research that)

	"In light of the resolution passed by the Los Angeles City Council as well as the verbal and physical attacks on undergraduate Muslim students on campus this week, we — as both Jewish and non-Jewish students and faculty of UCLA — are writing to firmly advise UCLA to refrain from intervening against the planned NSJP conference at UCLA.

	Additionally, in light of the Yad Yamin protest on November 6, we seriously urge the University to take extraordinary measures to protect the safety of conference attendees. The safety of students must be prioritized over dangerous political stunts. We must agree with City Councilman Paul Koretz (https://bit.ly/2RCES1Y)) that “our campuses should never become an environment where students of any origin are harassed, bullied, or prohibited from learning.” Given the ongoing harassment of Muslim students on our campus by outside groups and individuals, the safety of Muslim students attending the conference is a grave and critical concern."

	"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been among the most volatile issues at UCLA, but that volatility cannot prevent us from addressing it."

	"Some students, community members and even the Los Angeles City Council, concerned by anti-Semitic statements made by some SJP members around the country, have demanded that UCLA cancel the event."

	"On both routine academic matters and controversial issues, the overwhelming majority of university leaders — and that includes me — strive to preserve the rights of all sides to speak and be heard. At the same time, we recognize the often existential impact of emotionally charged debates about issues like the Mideast conflict, immigration, affirmative action and abortion. Preserving the right to speak about such issues does not validate the content of that speech. All too often affording a group their constitutional rights is falsely perceived as an institutional endorsement of their message."

	"It remains an awkward reality that our constitutional system, and democracy’s commitment to open debate, demand that Americans allow speech we may oppose."

	"When SJP announced its intention to hold its national conference at UCLA, the university recognized its legal right to do so. Much of what will be said at that conference may be deeply objectionable — even personally hurtful — to those who believe that a complex conflict is being reduced to a one-sided caricature, or see a double standard that demonizes the world’s only Jewish state while other countries receive less condemnation for dreadful behavior. Indeed, there is fear among some that the conference will be infused with anti-Semitic rhetoric."

		- CNN didn't run a news story announcing their investigation either; they investigated, and then they ran a news story. As part of that investigation, they reached out to people who were collecting information, and then they corroborated that information. I was one of those people. No one from any law enforcement agency has reached out to me or any of my contacts. Which is to say that law enforcement is not investigating as rigorously as CNN did.

	"RG Cravens, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, has tracked the Leave Our Kids Alone protests since they began disrupting school board meetings last summer and threw their weight behind a controversial anti-trans statewide ballot measure.

	The reason these counter-demonstrators are drawn to protests over the war in the Middle East, he said, was that they see them through the prism of a broader rightwing view that “traditional” societies and families are under threat. “Their animosity towards the campus demonstrations are part of this Christian far-right perspective that LGBTQ folks are threats to Christianity, and so are Palestinians or Muslims,” Cravens said."
