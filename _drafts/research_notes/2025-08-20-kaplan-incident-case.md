## Kaplan Incident (Oct 11, 2023) — Records Paradox

### What exists in the record
- **SAMs report** — documents:  
  - Grad student slapped  
  - SAM staffer physically contacted  
  - Parent threatened with group-based hate  
  - Intervention prevented escalation but was not true resolution  
- **Monroe → Beck email (Oct 11)** — asks whether PD has opened an investigation, offers to send video to Chief Thomas.  
- **Daily Bruin (Oct 25)** — UCLA spokesperson says investigation is ongoing, SAMs intervened, accountability forthcoming.  
- **Chancellor Block (Oct 27)** — campus-wide message invoking “visitors” and antisemitism; no direct reference to Kaplan.  
### What’s missing
- **No PD investigation records** (Oct 9–Nov 9 CPRA request produced zero).  
- **No admin follow-up emails** reflecting an actual investigative process.  
- **No accountability actions** documented.  

### Paradox
- Internal documentation (SAMs report + Monroe email) shows **serious misconduct** that should trigger investigation.  
- Public communication (DB spokesperson) states investigation is ongoing.  
- Records search shows **no investigation ever occurred** (or was documented).  

### Interpretive fork
- If investigation did occur → UCLA unlawfully withheld records or failed to document properly.  
- If investigation did not occur → UCLA misled the public and abandoned accountability despite having actual knowledge of violence.  

### Significance
- Demonstrates UCLA’s early pattern of **reputational management over substantive safety response**.  
- Exposes a gap between **what admin told the public** and **what the institutional record shows**.  
- Fits the broader theme: **visibility produces rhetoric, not accountability.**

## Kaplan Incident (Oct 11, 2023) — Records Collection Notes

### Records obtained

- **SAMs Report**  
  - Documents physical assault (grad student slapped)  
  - Physical contact with SAM staffer  
  - Group-based hate threats against a parent  
  - SAMs’ presence prevented further escalation  

- **Admin Email (Oct 11)**  
  - Monroe Gorden → Michael Beck: asks if PD has opened an investigation, offers to send video to UCPD Chief Thomas  
  - Beck reply: repeats staff claim that one aggressor was an “SJP leader” (contradicted by video/context)  

- **Faculty Letter (Jenny Sharpe, Oct 12, 2023)**  
  - Reports **English dept. office received harassing calls** over the Palestine teach-in  
  - Office manager requested to go home for safety  
  - Teach-in moved to Zoom due to threats  
  - Urges Chancellor/EDI to issue a statement ensuring equal recognition of Arab and Palestinian students’ safety and rights  

- **Chancellor Block Statement (Oct 13, 2023)**  
  - Issued after being urged by faculty to respond   
  - Includes broad language on free expression and general safety guidance (CAPS, RISE, UCPD)  
  - Does **not** reference the Kaplan incident or acknowledge specific risks faced by arab, muslim, or pro-Palestinian students 

- **Daily Bruin Coverage (Oct 25, 2023)**  
  - Student walkout referenced Kaplan harassment as unresolved  
  - UCLA spokesperson: SAMs intervened, incident under investigation, accountability forthcoming  
  - Adds: believed harassers not UCLA students/affiliates  

- **Chancellor Block Statement (Oct 27, 2023)**  
  - Campus-wide “Maintaining a safe environment” message  
  - Mentions “visitors” as potential source of people feeling unsafe  
  - Condemns antisemitism (twice), Islamophobia, other bigotry, but avoids naming Kaplan  

- **Provost Darnell Hunt Email (Oct 2023)**  
  - Asks staff how “terrorist attacks” will factor into Dialogue Across Difference programming  
  - Refers to “reports… of students being accosted for attending a Palestine panel and other teach-ins presumed to be anti-Semitic”  
  - Hands issue off to Beck; notes discussion with Chancellor Block about incident and about needing to prepare for ongoing activity  

- **Student Email to Faculty (Makdisi, Kaplan organizer)**  
  - Firsthand report from student who attended  
  - Notes guards “let the men go” after Kaplan confrontation  
  - Later saw same men standing at Bruin Plaza at the vigil for Israel (≈7:00 pm)  

### Records missing
- **No PD investigation records** (none produced under CPRA Oct 9–Nov 9, 2023)  
- **No internal follow-up communications** showing actual investigative progress  
- **No documented accountability actions**  

### Key contradictions
- UCLA spokesperson (Oct 25) claimed investigation was ongoing with accountability to follow.  
- CPRA request covering Oct 9–Nov 9 produced **zero records** to substantiate an investigation.  
- Faculty urged Block to address Kaplan directly, but his Oct 13 and Oct 27 statements reframed events broadly around antisemitism and other forms of bigotry, general safety, and visitor conduct.  
- Internal communications (Beck mis-ID; Hunt’s “student dialogue issue” framing) diverged sharply from on-the-ground accounts (SAMs report, student eyewitness, video).  

### Significance
- Shows how quickly the Kaplan incident was reframed away from concrete violence and discrimination-motivated threats into abstract “tolerance” and safety language.  
- Demonstrates **mismatch between public assurances of investigation and absence of investigative records**.  
- Provides early evidence of administrative response failure: reputational messaging substituted for accountability.
