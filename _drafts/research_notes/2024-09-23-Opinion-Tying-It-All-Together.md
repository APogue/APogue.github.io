	- "Conservative undergraduates are less likely to feel that students of their political affiliation are respected on campus than those with liberal or moderate political opinions."

	- "First, I show that ending AA caused substantial and persistent educational and labor market deterioration among URM UC applicants: each of UC's 10,000 annual URM freshman applicants' likelihood of earning a Bachelor's degree declined by 1.3 percentage points, their likelihood of earning any graduate degree declined 1.4 p.p., and their likelihood of earning at least $100,000 in each year between ages 30 and 37 declined by about 1 p.p. per year. These results imply that affirmative action's end decreased the number of age 30-to-34 URM Californians earning over $100,000 by at least 2.5 percent. Second, I show that ending AA did not improve URM students' relative performance or persistence in core physical, biological, or mathematical science courses, within or across impacted universities. These findings suggest that state prohibitions on university affirmative action policies have modestly exacerbated American socioeconomic inequities."
