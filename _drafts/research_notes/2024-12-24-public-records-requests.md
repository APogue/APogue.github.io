## Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Oct 12

- Dhunt using the wrong approach to address the harassment incident 

	- "I'm reaching out to see how the terrorist attacks will figure into Dialogue Across Difference
	programming this year? We're receiving reports, like the one below, of students being
	accosted for attending a Palestine panel and other teach-ins presumed to be Anti-Semitic."

	- "Thank you, David! I just handed this off to Michael Beck. He and his team are going to run with
	it."

	- "Yes, please confer with David to see what he has in mind. Gene and I discussed this today and we
	believe there will be more activity related to this crisis in the coming weeks and months and we
	need to be as prepared as possible."

- Email to Makdisi (a Kaplan teach-in organizer) reporting the incident from a student who was there

	- "I think the guards let the men go because I saw some of them standing at Bruin Plaza at around 7:00 pm at the vigil for Israel."

- David Myers 

	- "Just a thought. Might it sense to convene an emergency working group on this that
	includes representatives from admin, faculty, and staff, especially student affairs?"

- Michael Beck 

	- "Yes. I will have Student Affairs reach out to her. Sorry she had to endure that."

- Jenny Sharpe letter (the day before Block put out another message)

	- "Despite the event not being promoted as sponsored by any university department, the English
	front desk received so many harassing calls that the office manager requested to go home for her
	own safety. The teach-in was subsequently moved to Zoom."

	- "I urge the EDI and Chancellor’s office to write a follow-up message to the Bruin community to
	ensure that the rights and safety of Arab and Palestinian students are equally acknowledged and
	recognized and that the Chancellor's call for mutual respect extends to both our Jewish and Arab
	community. A peaceful teach-in about the Occupied Territories of Palestine should be able to
	take place without attacks on and threats to UCLA staff and student, parent, and faculty
	participants."

- SAM report

	- "One man of Middle Eastern descent in his mid to late 20s with black hair and a beard walked down the hallway and appeared to get a drink of water. Shortly a�er, two more men approached Miller and Price and asked where the men’s room was. A�er asking the ques�on they began to rush down the hallway, pulling masks up and yelling at the students."

	- "The students stood up as the three men ran at them. The men yelled and called the students “Terrorists,
	rapists, and baby murderers. Price and Miller were able to get in between the students and the men.
	Two more men joined the three who were yelling. Price was able to block them as they tried to get at
	the students. Miller helped the students get out the door at the end of the hall to get outside."

	- "One of the men flipped the trash can and then began to try to flip
	the table but instead just slammed that down three or four �mes. Another two of the men were able to
	get in between the father and the first-year undergraduate student. The father kept saying we only want
	peace; we only want peace. One of the men pulled out a cell phone and screamed if you only want
	peace, then go on record denouncing Iran. The man was very close to the father with his phone
	recording; the father then said into the phone that he denounces Iran."

	- "A�er the female student le� with her items, Miller atempted to de-escalate by communica�ng with the
	men. They kept yelling how can you let baby killers and terrorists do this on campus? Miller responded
	that UCLA is commited to free speech and will always atempt to create environments where people
	have a space to express themselves. At this point, one of the men wearing a green jacket and green mask
	began to try and rip off Miller’s name tag. Price then pushed the man to create more space."

	- "Three people were remaining in addi�on to Miller and Price and
	the five men who were disrup�ng the event; one girl, who was later iden�fied as a graduate student,
	was protes�ng the speech was si�ng on the east side of the hallway at a table A first-year
	undergraduate student and her father...One of the men then accidentally slapped the female graduate student standing near the table. She yelled that she was on their side, and another man apologized and hugged her, saying, “Sister, we are so sorry.” Once the apologized, the female graduate student stopped yelling." - accidental seems to be referring to the political "side" the girl was on. Did he accidentally slap someone or accidentally slap the wrong person?

	- "Once there was space, Miller said he understood their pain; he is Jewish, but their atempt to shut down
	speech and harass students is doing more damage than good. At this point, the men were beginning to calm down, and they sprinted and le� out the Northeast door."

	- "Kaupalolo shared that the first-year student, if she would like to report this incident, can file that report with the Dean of Students. Miller shared addi�onal resources, like CAPS, that she should reach out to if she was feeling anxious or overwhelmed."

	- "Two UCPD officers arrived on the scene, Price and Miller gave their descrip�ons, an the officers went to look for the men."

	- Looking at the text messages there seems to be a discrepancy about whether there were 4 or 5 individuals 

- EDI report was filed

- Monroe Gorden Jr. Vice Chancellor, UCLA Student Affairs 

	- "Michael, do we know whether PD has opened an investigation into the assault (there is a video
	circulating that can be sent to JT if they do not already have it)?"

	- "Thanks Michael, perhaps you and I can meet on Monday to discuss. I’m concerned about the fact
	that these individuals engaged in violence toward a staff member, and feel that we need to work to
	hold them accountable, otherwise it these types of events may get worse."

	- **THIS NEEDS FOLLOW UP**



## April 25 - May 2nd


### From Responsive Records Redacted Part 1

- Letter dated April 27th, "It will end up in a huge conflict if left to fester and it will be a significant bigger embarrassment when a huge fight breaks out on campus between students."

- Letter dated April 27th, "Since day 1 of these encampments, these counter protestors (some of whom aren’t from the school) have yelled insults and threats at the protestors in the tents. I'm making you aware as they've been hostile and aggressive and are intentionally making problems to shut down the encampments...Please increase security and protect the encampments and the pro Palestinian protestors and their freedom of expression from these counter protestors who are intentionally causing trouble. Thank you for being supportive and protecting freedom of expression in a safe and respectful way. Thanks, a concerned parent of a UCLA student"

- Letter sent to Regents that eventually made its way to Block (4/29/2024 2:22:37 PM ), "Forwards April 28, 2024 email from Craig Samuels relating concerns about antisemitic and anti-Zionist speech and activities on campus and providing **web address for an Instagram viral video**. Requests response."

	"I’ve emailed you previously with respect to UCLA and rampant antisemitism on
	campus. I am forwarding a viral video demanding the Regents investigate and suspend and expel these students. There is no privacy rights to encampments on public property. UCLA is a public university funded by the taxpayer. The video highlights the Regents ongoing failure to protect the safety and security of Jewish students. I expect a reply and a letter to all students and members of the UCLA community discussing this incident, denouncing it, and reiterating UCLA commitment to the safety of its student body."

### From Responsive Records Redacted Part 2

- Overwhelmingly Jewish parents and professors condemning the encampment 

- UCLAPR_0000316, "Refers to statements made at the May 2, 2024 Alumni Association webinar that there were no injuries sustained during the May 1, 2024 protest at the pro-Palestinian encampment. Provides photos of a student hospitalized with an injury received from police. Recommends that this student and others affected by police violence receive a
public apology from the administration."

- Whereas previous UC protests were aimed at getting the attention of authorities, the new protesters aim has been to marginalize, malign and intimidate Jewish students and faculty on UCLA campus. It led to the peaceful counter rally of Sunday noon, April 28, organized by the Israeli American Council (IAC). This rally has changed public perception of the protest, and unmasked its racist anti-Zionist character by allowing Jewish students and faculty to share their experience on a visible public platform. Two days later, Chancellor Block declared the encampment unlawful. In summary, Drake was wrong and IAC was right.

- Unfortunately, the declaration of unlawfulness was not followed with a firm ultimatum, time table and Police presence, and that led to the UCLAPR_0000260 horrible and condemnable riots the night of May 1st. I've joined the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group in condemning those riots, regardless of who the perpetrators were. I have emphasized however that the violence would have been avoided had UCLA taken stronger and timely action against the unlawful and racist encampment. 

- These latest events should not divert us from demanding (1) investigation into the Medical School antisemitism, (2)transparency of the “antisemitism task force" fig leaf and (3) the root cause of it all: anti-Zionist faculty using university websites for political propaganda. (I call them “Hamas intellectual tunnels dug under our campus’). 

- There is an epidemic of antisemitism across the UC system, including at UCLA. It began long
before October 7, 2023 and has worsened dramatically since then. The UC Chancellors have had
six months to deal with the surge of antisemitism and have failed. Not one student or faculty
member has been disciplined on any UC campus for antisemitic conduct since October 7. The
knife-wielding UCLA students were not disciplined. The violent rioters at UC Berkeley are
supposedly "under investigation," but no discipline has resulted thus far. Nor were those who
threatened the Jewish student government president at UC Santa Barbara subjected to any form
of discipline. None of the Professors at UC Davis, UC Merced, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Santa
Barbara and elsewhere who made vile antisemitic comments and threatening statements have
faced any discipline. No UC Chancellor would ever have allowed this to happen if it were aimed at
black students/faculty. The double-standard is obvious. The unequal treatment of Jewish students
and facuity is morally reprehensible and a violation of the university's legal obligations under Title
Vl and the Equal Protection Clause. 

- Finally, there seems to be a great deal of confusion inside the UCLA administration regarding
the nature and extent of First Amendment free speech and free assembly rights. Freedom of
Assembly and the right to protest are sacrosanct, as long as they are conducted "peaceably." Not
"mostly" peaceably, but "peaceably." The Administration has every right to ask the UCPD to arrest
or forcibly remove/relocate non-peaceful protestors, including from public property and/or from
public events. The Administration also has every right to enforce reasonable time, place and
manner restrictions to ensure protestors do not block or disrupt campus events and activities,
including speakers with whom the protestors disagree. Freedom of Speech protects vile and
hateful speech, but it does not confer any rights to block or prevent others from exercising their
own free speech rights. Nor do the first amendment rights of those propagating hate preclude the
UCLA administration from condemning such hate speech in the strongest possible terms.
Therefore, all UC Chancellors (including Chancellor Block and whoever succeeds him at UCLA)
should receive first amendment training as soon as possible, so they understand the exact nature
and extent of freedom of speech and assembly, including their power to enforce reasonable time,
place and manner restrictions. The training should be conducted by a retired federal judge, not by
any current UC faculty. 

- Refers to statements made at the May 2, 2024 Alumni Association webinar that there were no injuries sustained
during the May 1, 2024 protest at the pro-Palestinian encampment. Provides photos of a student hospitalized with
an injury received from police. Recommends that this student and others affected by police violence receive a
public apology from the administration. 


- Teddy Schwarzman refers in his May 1st letter to the incident where a pro-Israeli protester was hit in the head. Some online writing says it was another pro-Israel, I don't believe the LA times committed to who they believe hit the woman, they said "another demonstrator." People in the community emailing the university think it was a pro-Palestinian demonstrator.

- As a university dedicated to learning and the search for truth, we hold the exchange of ideas and the
diversity of viewpoints to be fundamental. To claim control of a shared physical space and to impose
an intellectual and ideological litmus test are not in keeping with our bedrock principles and values. 

### pgs 108 ++ 

- people are angry about students blocking areas of campus --- they put a lot of trust in Block --- as if he is involved at all in what's going on 

- people are also very aware about what is going on either through their children or social media. UCLA essentially allowed this to go on so long it was all over social media

	- April 30th - I have had TWO Hollywood Industry
colleagues reach out to me today over this video....who have regularly come in to class over the years
as guests to speak with my students now tell me that they no longer feel comfortable coming to
UCLA's campus and speaking with my students because of UCLA administration's lack of action
supporting Jewish students. 

	- April 29th - How much more violence do you need an Campus to shut it down?
| was threatened yesterday to have My house burnt down, called a pedophile, and threatened to
break my jaw.
Jewish students are being blocked from entering building to their classes.
The protestors are aggressive and antisemitic.
Are you simply waiting for someone to get seriously injured or worse?
Please do something positive. 

	- April 29th - As a UCLA Law alum (go Bruins!), I am shocked to see videos of Jewish UCLA
students being prevented by masked protesters from entering UCLA classrooms and
buildings, while UCLA campus security slands by without interfering. T love UCLA
and its tradition of academic excellence & free speech....but there’s a big difference
between a protest and deliberately preventing members of a minority group from being
able to attend class. If UCLA allows this to continue, either by action or inaction, then
it appears that UCLA has now decided there’s one minority group that it is OK to
discriminate against. And THAT is not UCLA’s way. 

	- April 29th - Debora Southern - As a leader of University of California, Los Angeles during a time marked by violence, you have the capability to use your role and power within our institution to either bring police violence to
our campus and violate the human rights of our students as they peacefully protest, or choose to
use your power to protect our students and their freedom. I urge you to continue to protect our
students as they peacefully protest. 

	- April 30th - from a parent - I am all for free speech, protesting and demonstrating (even when I disagree with
the messages), however the encampment on campus is violating students’ rights to pass freely, enter
buildings and attend classes. On top of this, the intimidation the protestors are using is
unacceptable, not to mention the vandalism they are causing by painting on buildings and the walkways. 

- incidents of violence

	- April 29th - Who assaulted a Jewish man on campus. Regrettably, this altercation
unfolded in full view of UCLA security personnel...which included striking the individual and employing a taser,
not only contravene university regulations by introducing a weapon onto campus
but also constitute a grave physical assault. It is imperative that swift and decisive
action be taken in response to such egregious behavior. 

	- April 29th - My son is a first-year student at UCLA in the Math Department. He was accosted coming of the east entrance of the Powell Library today while making his way to class. He was forced to put his hands on a protester to
push him off after the protested held him back from going to class. My son went for help at the campus police
station and was told the campus police are under the directive not to protect the students from the protesters.
Mr. Chancellor, Sir, If you cannot protect your students such as my son at UCLA perhaps you should designate
the responsibility to an administrator who will oversee how to protect them.
My son is traumatized by the protestors. He is having difficulty going to class and studying for mid-terms, which
are tomorrow. 

	- April 28th - Surely it's gone on long enough? I've seen videos of pepper spray, intimidation, outsiders coming onto
campus to inflame matters even further. This is blatant anti-semitism being allowed to erupt and it
would never be tolerated if any other group were being targeted. Why no consequences? Enough is
enough! My son called me. Jewish or not. He's scared. Those are his words. I'm paying tuition for him to
receive an unfettered education, and that means he can walk to class safely, be treated fairly by
professors that deal in facts and not personal vendettas and propaganda and surely not watch UCLA
become a national lightning rod because our administration won't do anything. How is this even
remotely ok? The pro-Hamas protestors, most of whom are ignorant of history, have had their jollies.
It's time to clean up and return to class. What this means for the UCLA community and any sense of
cohesion, I don't know. It's very sad. 

- also letters from parents after May 5th who were upset about remote learning and concerned about graduation
