## Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Oct 12

- Dhunt using the wrong approach to address the harassment incident 

	- "I'm reaching out to see how the terrorist attacks will figure into Dialogue Across Difference
	programming this year? We're receiving reports, like the one below, of students being
	accosted for attending a Palestine panel and other teach-ins presumed to be Anti-Semitic."

	- "Thank you, David! I just handed this off to Michael Beck. He and his team are going to run with
	it."

	- "Yes, please confer with David to see what he has in mind. Gene and I discussed this today and we
	believe there will be more activity related to this crisis in the coming weeks and months and we
	need to be as prepared as possible."

- Email to Makdisi (a Kaplan teach-in organizer) reporting the incident from a student who was there

	- "I think the guards let the men go because I saw some of them standing at Bruin Plaza at around 7:00 pm at the vigil for Israel."

- David Myers 

	- "Just a thought. Might it sense to convene an emergency working group on this that
	includes representatives from admin, faculty, and staff, especially student affairs?"

- Michael Beck 

	- "Yes. I will have Student Affairs reach out to her. Sorry she had to endure that."

- Jenny Sharpe letter (the day before Block put out another message)

	- "Despite the event not being promoted as sponsored by any university department, the English
	front desk received so many harassing calls that the office manager requested to go home for her
	own safety. The teach-in was subsequently moved to Zoom."

	- "I urge the EDI and Chancellor’s office to write a follow-up message to the Bruin community to
	ensure that the rights and safety of Arab and Palestinian students are equally acknowledged and
	recognized and that the Chancellor's call for mutual respect extends to both our Jewish and Arab
	community. A peaceful teach-in about the Occupied Territories of Palestine should be able to
	take place without attacks on and threats to UCLA staff and student, parent, and faculty
	participants."

- SAM report

	- "One man of Middle Eastern descent in his mid to late 20s with black hair and a beard walked down the hallway and appeared to get a drink of water. Shortly a�er, two more men approached Miller and Price and asked where the men’s room was. A�er asking the ques�on they began to rush down the hallway, pulling masks up and yelling at the students."

	- "The students stood up as the three men ran at them. The men yelled and called the students “Terrorists,
	rapists, and baby murderers. Price and Miller were able to get in between the students and the men.
	Two more men joined the three who were yelling. Price was able to block them as they tried to get at
	the students. Miller helped the students get out the door at the end of the hall to get outside."

	- "One of the men flipped the trash can and then began to try to flip
	the table but instead just slammed that down three or four �mes. Another two of the men were able to
	get in between the father and the first-year undergraduate student. The father kept saying we only want
	peace; we only want peace. One of the men pulled out a cell phone and screamed if you only want
	peace, then go on record denouncing Iran. The man was very close to the father with his phone
	recording; the father then said into the phone that he denounces Iran."

	- "A�er the female student le� with her items, Miller atempted to de-escalate by communica�ng with the
	men. They kept yelling how can you let baby killers and terrorists do this on campus? Miller responded
	that UCLA is commited to free speech and will always atempt to create environments where people
	have a space to express themselves. At this point, one of the men wearing a green jacket and green mask
	began to try and rip off Miller’s name tag. Price then pushed the man to create more space."

	- "Three people were remaining in addi�on to Miller and Price and
	the five men who were disrup�ng the event; one girl, who was later iden�fied as a graduate student,
	was protes�ng the speech was si�ng on the east side of the hallway at a table A first-year
	undergraduate student and her father...One of the men then accidentally slapped the female graduate student standing near the table. She yelled that she was on their side, and another man apologized and hugged her, saying, “Sister, we are so sorry.” Once the apologized, the female graduate student stopped yelling." - accidental seems to be referring to the political "side" the girl was on. Did he accidentally slap someone or accidentally slap the wrong person?

	- "Once there was space, Miller said he understood their pain; he is Jewish, but their atempt to shut down
	speech and harass students is doing more damage than good. At this point, the men were beginning to calm down, and they sprinted and le� out the Northeast door."

	- "Kaupalolo shared that the first-year student, if she would like to report this incident, can file that report with the Dean of Students. Miller shared addi�onal resources, like CAPS, that she should reach out to if she was feeling anxious or overwhelmed."

	- "Two UCPD officers arrived on the scene, Price and Miller gave their descrip�ons, an the officers went to look for the men."

	- Looking at the text messages there seems to be a discrepancy about whether there were 4 or 5 individuals 

- EDI report was filed

- Monroe Gorden Jr. Vice Chancellor, UCLA Student Affairs 

	- "Michael, do we know whether PD has opened an investigation into the assault (there is a video
	circulating that can be sent to JT if they do not already have it)?"

	- "Thanks Michael, perhaps you and I can meet on Monday to discuss. I’m concerned about the fact
	that these individuals engaged in violence toward a staff member, and feel that we need to work to
	hold them accountable, otherwise it these types of events may get worse."

	- **THIS NEEDS FOLLOW UP**



## April 25 - May 2nd


### From Responsive Records Redacted Part 1

- Letter dated April 27th, "It will end up in a huge conflict if left to fester and it will be a significant bigger embarrassment when a huge fight breaks out on campus between students."

- Letter dated April 27th, "Since day 1 of these encampments, these counter protestors (some of whom aren’t from the school) have yelled insults and threats at the protestors in the tents. I'm making you aware as they've been hostile and aggressive and are intentionally making problems to shut down the encampments...Please increase security and protect the encampments and the pro Palestinian protestors and their freedom of expression from these counter protestors who are intentionally causing trouble. Thank you for being supportive and protecting freedom of expression in a safe and respectful way. Thanks, a concerned parent of a UCLA student"

- Letter sent to Regents that eventually made its way to Block (4/29/2024 2:22:37 PM ), "Forwards April 28, 2024 email from Craig Samuels relating concerns about antisemitic and anti-Zionist speech and activities on campus and providing **web address for an Instagram viral video**. Requests response."

	"I’ve emailed you previously with respect to UCLA and rampant antisemitism on
	campus. I am forwarding a viral video demanding the Regents investigate and suspend and expel these students. There is no privacy rights to encampments on public property. UCLA is a public university funded by the taxpayer. The video highlights the Regents ongoing failure to protect the safety and security of Jewish students. I expect a reply and a letter to all students and members of the UCLA community discussing this incident, denouncing it, and reiterating UCLA commitment to the safety of its student body."

### From Responsive Records Redacted Part 2

- Overwhelmingly Jewish parents and professors condemning the encampment 

- UCLAPR_0000316, "Refers to statements made at the May 2, 2024 Alumni Association webinar that there were no injuries sustained during the May 1, 2024 protest at the pro-Palestinian encampment. Provides photos of a student hospitalized with an injury received from police. Recommends that this student and others affected by police violence receive a
public apology from the administration."
