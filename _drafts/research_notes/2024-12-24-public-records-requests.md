## Notes 

### April 25 - May 2nd

- From Responsive Records Redacted Part 2

	- Overwhelmingly Jewish parents and professors condemning the encampment 

	- UCLAPR_0000316, "Refers to statements made at the May 2, 2024 Alumni Association webinar that there were no injuries sustained during the May 1, 2024 protest at the pro-Palestinian encampment. Provides photos of a student hospitalized with an injury received from police. Recommends that this student and others affected by police violence receive a
	public apology from the administration."

- From Responsive Records Redacted Part 1

	- Letter dated April 27th, "It will end up in a huge conflict if left to fester and it will be a significant bigger embarrassment when a huge fight breaks out on campus between students."

	- Letter dated April 27th, "Since day 1 of these encampments, these counter protestors (some of whom aren’t from the school) have yelled insults and threats at the protestors in the tents. I'm making you aware as they've been hostile and aggressive and are intentionally making problems to shut down the encampments...Please increase security and protect the encampments and the pro Palestinian protestors and their freedom of expression from these counter protestors who are intentionally causing trouble. Thank you for being supportive and protecting freedom of expression in a safe and respectful way. Thanks, a concerned parent of a UCLA student"

	- Letter sent to Regents that eventually made its way to Block (4/29/2024 2:22:37 PM ), "Forwards April 28, 2024 email from Craig Samuels relating concerns about antisemitic and anti-Zionist speech and activities on campus and providing **web address for an Instagram viral video**. Requests response."

		"I’ve emailed you previously with respect to UCLA and rampant antisemitism on
		campus. I am forwarding a viral video demanding the Regents investigate and suspend and expel these students. There is no privacy rights to encampments on public property. UCLA is a public university funded by the taxpayer. The video highlights the Regents ongoing failure to protect the safety and security of Jewish students. I expect a reply and a letter to all students and members of the UCLA community discussing this incident, denouncing it, and reiterating UCLA commitment to the safety of its student body."
