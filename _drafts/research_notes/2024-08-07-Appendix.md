### Appendix 

- USAC 

- UCLA EVP

- [Eva Jussim EVP 2023-2024](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzxE9LbPZm2/)

	- Rhetoric in this statement recognizes all parties involved in this conflict

		- "I am deeply dismayed by the level of hate directed at Jewish and Middle Eastern communities...I stand firmly against the occupation of Palestine, the displacement of the Palestinian people, and the kidnapping of Israeli civilians."

	- Addressed UC rhetoric in response to Oct 7th

		- "During President Drake's meeting with the EVPs of the 9 campuses on October 26, 2023, he committed to drafting a second statement addressing these atrocities and the surge in violence. No statement has been published. I urge both Chancellor Block and President Drake to directly address the increase in hate crimes on our campuses and the compromised sense of student safety both on and off-campus. "

- Javier Nunez-Verdugo

- [Candidates in upcoming USAC elections participate in solidarity encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/29/candidates-in-upcoming-usac-elections-participate-in-solidarity-encampment)

	- "“As someone who identifies very strongly with their indigenous identity to Mexico, I very much sympathize with the ongoing fight for Palestinian liberation, as they’re indigenous to their homeland and are currently being displaced,” they said. "

	- "Nuñez-Verdugo said they support the use of USAC money – which comes from student fees – to fund resources for the encampment, adding that students should be provided a space to engage in activism on campus."

- [UCLA external VP becomes involved with "death to Israel" post](https://www.instagram.com/sababasisters/p/DAhOEGaStSJ/), this post looks fake in which case someone tried to set them up. The underline under the name is not normal. This is a case of targeting of pro-palestinian advocates at the university. 

	- "I do not believe this is real (the _ which appears partially under his name looks fake), BUT if it is he would immediately be relieved of his duties @UCLA"

### Incidents of discrimination

	- [Islamophobia on Campus](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17k6sx8/islamophobes_on_campus/)

	- [Counter-protesters](https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/08/student-organizations-host-rally-demanding-uclas-divestment-from-israel) attend a BDS rally

		- "A small number of counter-protesters also attended the rally, including a person holding an Israeli flag and heckling speakers outside of Murphy Hall. Although SJP has told rally attendees not to engage with counter-protesters in its guidelines, one speaker who did not give their name appeared to address them directly by insulting the physical characteristics of counter-protesters. Descriptions of physical characteristics are a common antisemitic trope, according to the Media Diversity Institute.

			“Do you realize how Zionists, … they have that ugly, half-American, half-Zionist smiles?” they said in a speech, leading to shouts of agreement from the crowd.

			The speaker also repeated insults at counter-protesters, even after being instructed not to engage with them by other organizers.

			“They’re just losers who are colonizers and settlers, and they will be defeated,” they said in a speech. “They are stupid, annoying and ugly.”"
