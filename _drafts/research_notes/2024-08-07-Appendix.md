- UCLA EVP

- [Eva Jussim EVP 2023-2024](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzxE9LbPZm2/)

	- Rhetoric in this statement recognizes all parties involved in this conflict

		- "I am deeply dismayed by the level of hate directed at Jewish and Middle Eastern communities...I stand firmly against the occupation of Palestine, the displacement of the Palestinian people, and the kidnapping of Israeli civilians."

	- Addressed UC rhetoric in response to Oct 7th

		- "During President Drake's meeting with the EVPs of the 9 campuses on October 26, 2023, he committed to drafting a second statement addressing these atrocities and the surge in violence. No statement has been published. I urge both Chancellor Block and President Drake to directly address the increase in hate crimes on our campuses and the compromised sense of student safety both on and off-campus. "

- Javier Nunez-Verdugo

- [jj.aviier March Regents Meeting with Pig effigy](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4wYcR4PRzn/?img_index=1), EVP did have pig effigy depiction on personal IG, now private.

- [Candidates in upcoming USAC elections participate in solidarity encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/29/candidates-in-upcoming-usac-elections-participate-in-solidarity-encampment)

	- "“As someone who identifies very strongly with their indigenous identity to Mexico, I very much sympathize with the ongoing fight for Palestinian liberation, as they’re indigenous to their homeland and are currently being displaced,” they said. "

	- "Nuñez-Verdugo said they support the use of USAC money – which comes from student fees – to fund resources for the encampment, adding that students should be provided a space to engage in activism on campus."

- [UCLA external VP becomes involved with "death to Israel" post](https://www.instagram.com/sababasisters/p/DAhOEGaStSJ/), this post looks fake in which case someone tried to set them up. The underline under the name is not normal. This is a case of targeting of pro-palestinian advocates at the university. 

	- "I do not believe this is real (the _ which appears partially under his name looks fake), BUT if it is he would immediately be relieved of his duties @UCLA"

	- [Op-ed by Gene Block](https://dailybruin.com/2018/11/18/national-students-for-justice-in-palestine-conference-goes-on-despite-on-campus-protest) argues that pro-Israel delegates should be allowed to participate 

	- [Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/65093f0232032a4edc39b4f9/1695104770978/A+Resolution+In+Favor+of+Equalized+Access+to+UCLA+for+Non-Commerical+Speech+Events%3B+Specifically+in+Regards+to+SJP.pdf), Resolution passed 11/13/18

	- There are [systems](https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/individual-student-code) in place and information is [available](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/student-conduct-faq) wrt conduct and [consequences](https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/2f52f587-8b22-4633-a4f5-d79ee25cea9b)

	- Effectively none of this matters, because if a student is reported, an [administrative hold](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1d4iy65/ucla_threatens_to_withhold_degrees_from/) is placed on their myUCLA account to force engagement 

### UCLA Mission

- ["Academic freedom in its fullest terms" (Mission and Values)](https://www.ucla.edu/about/mission-and-values)

- [1st amendment rights as a student at UCLA](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media)

### Incidents of discrimination

	- [Islamophobia on Campus](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17k6sx8/islamophobes_on_campus/)

	- [Counter-protesters](https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/08/student-organizations-host-rally-demanding-uclas-divestment-from-israel) attend a BDS rally

		- "A small number of counter-protesters also attended the rally, including a person holding an Israeli flag and heckling speakers outside of Murphy Hall. Although SJP has told rally attendees not to engage with counter-protesters in its guidelines, one speaker who did not give their name appeared to address them directly by insulting the physical characteristics of counter-protesters. Descriptions of physical characteristics are a common antisemitic trope, according to the Media Diversity Institute.

			“Do you realize how Zionists, … they have that ugly, half-American, half-Zionist smiles?” they said in a speech, leading to shouts of agreement from the crowd.

			The speaker also repeated insults at counter-protesters, even after being instructed not to engage with them by other organizers.

			“They’re just losers who are colonizers and settlers, and they will be defeated,” they said in a speech. “They are stupid, annoying and ugly.”"

### boycotts

- [PACBI Guidelines for the International Cultural Boycott of Israel](https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi/cultural-boycott-guidelines)

	- "The vagueness lies in the interpretation of what constitutes complicity and rebranding. For example, a cultural institution might be involved in activities that are apolitical or even critical of the Israeli government, yet it could still be targeted if it's seen as contributing to Israel's international image. This broad application can be problematic because it doesn't always allow for a nuanced understanding of the diverse roles that cultural institutions play, nor does it differentiate between varying degrees of involvement or complicity."

- [On Academic Boycotts](https://www.aaup.org/report/academic-boycotts)

	- "The Association’s defense of academic freedom, as explained in the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, rests on the principle that “institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good . . . [which] depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition.” Although the statement says nothing about academic boycotts, plainly the search for truth and its free expression suffer if a boycott is in place."

- [Statement on Academic Boycotts](https://www.aaup.org/report/statement-academic-boycotts)

- [American Enterprise Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute#:~:text=The%20American%20Enterprise%20Institute%20for,%2C%20economics%2C%20and%20social%20welfare.)

	- "The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, known simply as the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), is a conservative center-right/right-wing think tank based in Washington, D.C., that researches government, politics, economics, and social welfare."

- [The AAUP Is Wrong](https://www.aei.org/society-and-culture/the-aaup-is-wrong/)

	"In 2005, AAUP spoke out against calls from faculty to cancel and boycott scholars from Israeli institutions, saying that such actions “strike directly at the free exchange of ideas.” Fast-forward nearly twenty years, and the AAUP flipped its position to where boycotts “can be considered legitimate tactical responses to conditions that are fundamentally incompatible with the mission of higher education” and this change was made, according to Inside Higher Education, “in the context of Israel and Gaza.”

	To the AAUP, boycotts are now acceptable when they “legitimately seek to protect and advance the academic freedom and fundamental rights of colleagues and students who are living and working under circumstances that violate that freedom and one or more of those rights.”"
