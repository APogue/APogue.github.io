## Was Thomas negligent or deliberately negligent? 

- If Thomas himself wasn’t deliberately negligent, then the deliberate negligence must lie higher up — with campus leadership who:

	- Directed him not to use police in the plan,

	- Overrode or constrained his authority,

	- Ignored or minimized intelligence,

	- Or otherwise made choices that left the encampment unprotected.

- So the distinction matters because it lets me trace responsibility. If Thomas was only negligent (poor judgment), then the deliberate element shifts to the administration that gave or withheld orders. If Thomas was deliberately negligent, the responsibility sits with him.

		- "According to emails between UC police departments obtained by the Daily Bruin, UCLA requested additional aid from the police departments of various UC campuses, but UCPD Lieutenant Issac Koh then canceled the request at 11:25 a.m. April 26."

		- "“We are CANCELING our SRT call out /MUTUAL AID at this time. The campus is not ready to move to a police operation as of yet, and we don’t foresee any action happening that will require us at least this coming weekend,” Koh said in the email. “We may be talking to you in the coming weeks regarding mutual aid if our campus administration moves to clearing this out.”"

		- "Emails obtained by The Bruin reveal that officers from BHPD, CCPD, SMPD and UCPD, as well as several captains from LAPD, were requested to be added to a text group chat by then-UCPD Chief John Thomas – who was later reassigned."

		- "“These notification texts should provide this group with pertinent updates, intelligence that would be beneficial should we need to call them to respond to assist us with emergency issues involving the encampment protests in Royce Quad or elsewhere on campus,” Thomas said in an email obtained by The Bruin."

		- "The text thread was used by officers to communicate whereabouts and activity updates for not only the first encampment but for several of the other protests on campus that occurred throughout May and June, including informing the group about the arrests of 42 people at Parking Structure 2 on May 6.

			The officers inside the thread used it to tell each other where groups of protesters were moving, numbers of detainees and information about plans for new protests they had heard."

		- "“A new AVC is being brought in to oversee the PD and an advisory committee has been announced,” he said. “We are being told we will report to the new AVC.”"

	- 11:22 a.m.---"“This morning, a group of demonstrators breached a barrier that the university had established separating two groups of protestors on our campus, resulting in physical altercations. UCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken about the violence that broke out.”"

	- 4:19 p.m.---“UCLA has a long history of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken to report that today, some physical altercations broke out among demonstrators on Royce Quad.

		“We have since instituted additional security measures and increased the numbers of our safety team members on site."

		“As an institution of higher education, we stand firmly for the idea that even when we disagree, we must still engage respectfully and recognize one another’s humanity. We are dismayed that certain individuals instead chose to jeopardize the physical safety of the community.”

	- "“When protests erupt on campus, the decisions regarding the response of the UC Police rest firmly in the hands of campus leadership,” the union said in a statement."

	- "The union noted the difference between “operational execution,” which was under the departments, compared to “strategic direction,” which was controlled by the school administrators, according to the statement."

- [Monday 4/29](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/ucpd-responds-to-counter-protesters-midnight-attempt-to-breach-encampment)

	“Around 60 counter-protesters attempted to breach the entrance of the encampment in Dickson Plaza around midnight Tuesday morning, drawing the presence of six UCPD officers in riot gear.”

	"A fight between members of both sides broke out around 11:40 p.m., leading the six UCPD officers to separate counter-protesters and participants of the encampment. Protesters inside the encampment brought wooden planks to the Powell scaffolding to block the entrance. CSC security officers then used their bikes to create a barrier between UCPD, counter-protesters and those inside the encampment."

- [Mary Osako Tuesday 4/30 11:48 a.m.](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-30)

	 "“Yesterday some physical altercations occurred among demonstrators in Royce Quad. In response, we have taken several actions to significantly increase our security presence, including adding greater numbers of campus law enforcement, safety personnel and student affairs monitors. 


	“There was also a report of a student’s access to class being blocked by demonstrators yesterday. This kind of disruption to our teaching and learning mission is abhorrent, plain and simple. As such, we’ve taken several, immediate actions: Our student conduct process has been initiated, and could lead to severe disciplinary action including expulsion or suspension. The barriers that demonstrators used to block this student’s access to class have been removed and we have staff located around Royce Quad to help ensure that they will not go up again. We have also engaged law enforcement to investigate.


	“While the demonstration remains largely peaceful, our campus must remain a place where we treat one another with respect and recognize our shared humanity — not a place where we devolve into violence and bullying.” "

- [Gene Block Tuesday 4/30 5:04 p.m.](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/affirming-our-values-in-a-challenging-time)

	"Many of the demonstrators, as well as counter-demonstrators who have come to the area, have been peaceful in their activism. But the tactics of others have frankly been shocking and shameful. We have seen instances of violence completely at odds with our values as an institution dedicated to respect and mutual understanding. In other cases, students on their way to class have been physically blocked from accessing parts of the campus.


	UCLA supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid. These incidents have put many on our campus, especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear.


	In response, we’ve taken several immediate actions. We have significantly increased our security presence in the area, including adding greater numbers of law enforcement officers, safety personnel and student affairs mitigators. We have also engaged law enforcement to investigate the recent acts of violence. 


	The barriers that demonstrators used to block access to buildings have been removed, and we have staff located around Royce Quad to help ensure that they will not go up again. With regard to these incidents, our student conduct process has been initiated, and could lead to disciplinary action including suspension or expulsion."


### Thomas interview

- [UCLA’s top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-03/before-mob-attack-ucla-police-chief-was-ordered-to-create-security-plan-but-didnt-sources-say)

	


















































	- The article begins with, "The account of Thomas’ actions leading up to the attack was provided by three sources who were not authorized to speak publicly." Then Thomas gives his rebuttal. 

	- "Days earlier, campus leadership had directed Thomas to create a safety plan that would protect the UCLA community after the encampment was put up last week and began drawing agitators, the sources said. **The chief was told to spare no expense to bring in other UC police officers, offer overtime and hire as many private security officers needed to keep the peace.**"

	- “But university leadership, he said, decided to allow the tents “as an expression of students’ 1st Amendment rights” and directed that police not be included in any security plan. Under UC’s systemwide community safety plan, police are deployed as a last resort — guidance developed after UC Davis police pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters in 2011, setting off a firestorm of controversy and an internal review that changed campus practices.”

		“As a result, Thomas said he developed a plan that relied on private security and made sure to alert the Los Angeles Police Department of the need to respond immediately should problems arise. The private security guards, who were not authorized to make arrests, were instructed to contact UCLA police if needed.”

		“However, sources said he was directed to provide a written safety strategy outlining the response and preparation for various scenarios, such as a rally, skirmishes or violence — with the direction to do what was needed to keep the community safe — and he failed to deliver.”

	- "“He acknowledged that he did tell leadership that it would take just minutes to deploy police forces, but he was referring to a **general response** — not a force large enough to handle the size of the crowds that clashed that night. But three sources confirmed he was directly asked how long it would take for outside law enforcement to quell any violence.”"

	- "“As altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. **He could not recall exactly when that occurred**, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to secure their assistance.”

		“But he said the LAPD told him there was a problem with the payment system between the city and state, so the arrangements “couldn’t be done by the time of the attack.””

		- Based on the Newsroom updates, looks like this would have been April 30th

	- Thomas talks about mutual aid

		- “The mutual aid requests made Thursday and Friday, April 25-26 — which would have provided UCLA with more officers as they dealt with the camp and a dueling area erected by pro-Israel activists — were both canceled. Thomas said he made the requests because the university was tentatively planning to take down the encampment then, but he canceled them when that plan was delayed.”

			“He said he did not make any additional request after that because there was no specific reason for it at the time, but he directed his watch commander to do so immediately after learning about the attack, which he said was a “spontaneous” event. Critics are asking why he did not make another request sooner than that, after specific instances of physical altercations on Sunday and Monday.”
