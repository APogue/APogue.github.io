	- "Wyatt Reed is an editor at The Grayzone. As an international correspondent, he’s covered stories in over a dozen countries. Follow him on Twitter/X at @wyattreed13."

	- [Nouri Mehdizadeh](https://x.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1785194265301467187)

	- "According to the email from student activists, Mehdizadeh “was involved in planning violence continuously” and UCLA officials were likewise “warned about him continuously.”"

	- Track down any paper trail regarding officials being notified of specific bad actors

		- You have video of him on campus on a certain date. If you can find *any* correspondence between students and administrators before that date regarding his planned and executed "violence," that's the evidence you need

- Records request, Sunday April 28th, 2024

	- The university was aware of altercations

	- They stated that they instituted security measures

	- Myers states that he witnessed altercations on Sunday (mostly from counter-demonstrators)

	- [Mary Osako Sunday 4/28](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-28)- 

		- 11:22 a.m.---"“This morning, a group of demonstrators breached a barrier that the university had established separating two groups of protestors on our campus, resulting in physical altercations. UCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken about the violence that broke out.”"

		- 4:19 p.m.---“UCLA has a long history of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken to report that today, some physical altercations broke out among demonstrators on Royce Quad.

			“We have since instituted additional security measures and increased the numbers of our safety team members on site."

			“As an institution of higher education, we stand firmly for the idea that even when we disagree, we must still engage respectfully and recognize one another’s humanity. We are dismayed that certain individuals instead chose to jeopardize the physical safety of the community.”

		- "A small group of pro-Israel counter-protesters had also caused disturbances late Saturday evening and early Sunday morning, with some attempting to climb over the barricades around the encampment. A security guard hired by UCLA was allegedly pepper sprayed at around 8 a.m., and a demonstrator had blood on their face at around 12:30 p.m."

		- "After the counter-protest ended shortly before 1 p.m., participants began to disperse but were met by the pro-Palestine encampment supporters. UCPD officers lined up wearing riot gear near the Dickson Plaza flagpole as Palestine supporters interlocked arms on Portola Plaza, and counter-protesters waving Israeli flags surrounded them."

	- [I’m a UCLA professor. Why didn’t the administration stop last night’s egregious violence?](https://forward.com/opinion/608479/ucla-violence-campus-protests/), David Myers' full credentials need to be listed. He is currently the head of the team tasked with improving campus climate. He would be objective. 

	- "On Sunday..." He goes into specifics on this day and on the following Tuesday riot. 

	- 1. What communications occurred with respect to their knowledge of what occurred on Sunday? 

	- 2. What security measures were taken, and specifically what communications occurred between admin and ucpd? 

	- 3. Did Myers say anything, specifically to admin about Sunday's events?
