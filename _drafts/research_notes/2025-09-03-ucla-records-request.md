- [UCLA attackers exposed: meet the violent Zionist agitators LA police haven’t arrested](https://thegrayzone.com/2024/05/13/ucla-attackers-exposed/)

	- "Wyatt Reed is an editor at The Grayzone. As an international correspondent, he’s covered stories in over a dozen countries. Follow him on Twitter/X at @wyattreed13."

	- [Nouri Mehdizadeh on campus April 30th](https://x.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1785194265301467187)

		- He's being a menace in the above videos but nothing really worth citing him over

	- [Nouri shoves woman to the ground on Apr 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTzSU7pPl3U)

		- This one is more actionable

	- [Another angle](https://x.com/StopArabHate/status/1783876571230511143)

		- Doesn't look that bad from this angle

	- "According to the **email from student activists, Mehdizadeh “was involved in planning violence continuously” and UCLA officials were likewise “warned about him continuously.**”"

	- Track down any paper trail regarding officials being notified of specific bad actors                                 

		- You have video of him on campus on a certain date. If you can find *any* correspondence between students and administrators before that date regarding his planned and executed "violence," that's the evidence you need

	- Potential paper trail from [Catherine Hamilton](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/03/28/scxj-m28.html)

		- "When seeking safety at Haines Hall during the May 1 Zionist mob attack, Hamilton was denied access by UCLA’s private security even after repeated attempts to contact UCLA Media Relations for over three hours. **This resulted in Hamilton being repeatedly beaten and maced by Nouri Mehdizadeh and a small mob under his command while UCLA’s private security watched.**

		**Hamilton claims she has been repeatedly threatened and even assaulted by Mehdizadeh since April 27, with UCLA officials ignoring Hamilton’s numerous reports of this abuse.**"

	- [Catherine speaks to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs)

		- "As they walked past a line of cops and along a well-lit street in the center of campus, just before 3:30 am, she says they were encircled by a small group of counterprotesters mainly dressed in black. She told CNN the man leading the group was someone whom she immediately recognized. **He was a counterprotester who had previously verbally harassed her and taken a photo of her press badge, she said.**

		Within seconds, they sprayed the student journalists with a type of mace or pepper spray and flashed lights in their faces. As she tried to get away, Hamilton said, she was repeatedly struck in the chest and abdomen.

		One of the journalists confronted the attackers and shoved one before he was pummeled to the ground and beaten, according to video footage of the incident."

		- Daily Bruin news editor Catherine Hamilton, 21, **told The Times she recognized one of the counterprotesters as someone who had previously verbally harassed her and taken pictures of her press badge.** The individual instructed the group to encircle the student journalists, she said, **before they sprayed the four with Mace or pepper spray, flashed lights in their faces and chanted Hamilton’s name.**

	- Some harassers named (Liel Asherian, Nouri Mehdizadeh, Tom Bibiyan, Rony Yehuda, Narek Palyan, David Kaminsky, Aaron Cohen, Yossi Eilfort, Ivan Wolkind, Jonathan Yudelman, Sammy Ben)

- Records request, Sunday April 28th, 2024

	- The university was aware of altercations

	- They stated that they instituted security measures

	- Myers states that he witnessed altercations on Sunday (mostly from counter-demonstrators)

	- [Mary Osako Sunday 4/28](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-28)- 

		- 11:22 a.m.---"“This morning, a group of demonstrators breached a barrier that the university had established separating two groups of protestors on our campus, resulting in physical altercations. UCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken about the violence that broke out.”"

		- 4:19 p.m.---“UCLA has a long history of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken to report that today, some physical altercations broke out among demonstrators on Royce Quad.

			“We have since instituted additional security measures and increased the numbers of our safety team members on site."

			“As an institution of higher education, we stand firmly for the idea that even when we disagree, we must still engage respectfully and recognize one another’s humanity. We are dismayed that certain individuals instead chose to jeopardize the physical safety of the community.”

		- "A small group of pro-Israel counter-protesters had also caused disturbances late Saturday evening and early Sunday morning, with some attempting to climb over the barricades around the encampment. A security guard hired by UCLA was allegedly pepper sprayed at around 8 a.m., and a demonstrator had blood on their face at around 12:30 p.m."

		- "After the counter-protest ended shortly before 1 p.m., participants began to disperse but were met by the pro-Palestine encampment supporters. UCPD officers lined up wearing riot gear near the Dickson Plaza flagpole as Palestine supporters interlocked arms on Portola Plaza, and counter-protesters waving Israeli flags surrounded them."

	- [I’m a UCLA professor. Why didn’t the administration stop last night’s egregious violence?](https://forward.com/opinion/608479/ucla-violence-campus-protests/), David Myers' full credentials need to be listed. He is currently the head of the team tasked with improving campus climate. He would be objective.

	- 1. What communications occurred with respect to their knowledge of what occurred on Sunday? 

	- 2. What security measures were taken, and specifically what communications occurred between admin and ucpd? 

	- 3. Did Myers say anything, specifically to admin about Sunday's events?
