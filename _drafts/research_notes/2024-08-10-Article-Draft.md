## Attempts at Reform

- Office of Campus Safety

- https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-announces-nationally-recognized-firm-will-review-actions-led-violent-events-ucla

- Chancellor Block's congressional hearing (the story was UCLA was afraid for student safety? Was that how it really played out?)

- Is there any explanation for why protesters were not better regulated based on the time, place and manner restrictions that Block repeated so many times at the hearing? 

- Training and education don't go far enough

	- Existing Title VI education and policy/support infrastructure at UCLA

	- Proposed changes to education and policy/support infrastructure at UCLA

	- Title IX is mandatory

		- Some Title IX should be be grouped in with Title VI

## Reform Doesn't Address Systemic Issues

Thesis: Without addressing the issues underlying these incidents---now systemic problems---their inaction can be defined as "institutional negligence." 

- UCLA wants to address the symptoms---violence/safety/specific incidents of discrimination---but they continue to ignore the deeper issues

	- UCPD Chief was fired

	- Even with the new policing guy in place, police are still mishandling protest situations

		- https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/nyregion/how-the-nypd-quietly-shuts-down-discipline-cases-against-officers.html

	- Osako said "not to request law enforcement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community"

		- UCLA needs to define the threshold for "preemptively" in order to know what constitutes an "unsafe environment." Because the moment a non-affiliate shows up on campus with a mask on for example, the environment is now "unsafe."

		- Scuffles, fights and aggressive behavior occurred on several nights leading up to the 30th, the environment from that point forward is then "unsafe"

	- Are UCPD trained in non-affiliate policy? 

		- Why have the non-affiliate policies in place if they are not enforced? 

- The protest demands went far beyond the conflict in Gaza

	- The fact that the [demands weren't met](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-divestment) isn't what's important

		- Why were the demands so far reaching?

		- What does that mean for UCLA moving forward? 

			- The motivations behind these demands will continue to drive organizations like UC Divest, CAC, and SJP

- USAC represents an abuse of power 

	- Some voting data. The Jewish demographic does not represent a large enough voting bloc, theoretically or practically, to change election results. The Israeli students are a subset of both the international and Jewish communities, which means they cannot change USAC voting outcomes.

		- https://www.hillel.org/college/university-of-california-los-angeles/

		- https://www.ucla.edu/about/facts-and-figures

- Students post grievances on social media because they are accustomed to being "ignored" and they don't understand the accountability systems

	- There's a conflict of interest in the conduct-report-punishment loop

	- USAC can't be trusted to hold their own accountable

	- The "group" conduct policies could have been a way to hold CAC accountable, why didn't anyone know to use it? 

## Broader Impact and Data

- Comparative Analysis: Comparison with other UC's and their handling of the protests

- State witholding funds until regents come up with a plan

	- https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-15/uc-regents-say-no-to-encampments-and-codes-must-be-enforced#:~:text=%E2%80%9CEncampments%20are%20not%20allowed%2C%E2%80%9D,been%20in%20place%20since%202017.%E2%80%9D

- Will the state efforts at reform go far enough? 

	- They need to look farther than encampments and education

		- The USAC have re-elected Verdugo

			- Recent X posts (Obama follows CAC at UCLA) reveal anti-state of Israel rhetoric

				- https://x.com/culturalaffairs

				- reposts

		- The issue is broader than protests and encampments, UCLA itself is a "Jew Exclusion Zone" if the student government is permitted to continue with impunity

			- If the basis for exclusion at the encampments have somehow "bled" into USAC rhetoric, conduct, and policy; if this activity goes deeper than just the encampments themselves, this is the systemic problem 

			- While the issue continues to be conflated

				- https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1efhxn3/ucla_ordered_by_judge_to_craft_plan_in_support_of/

			- It should be made clear what the issue is---there is no "citizenship of UCLA" oath that a student is given when extended an offer to attend the university

- UCUES indicates 

	- 2014 https://sairo.ucla.edu/file/2563a13b-6aff-4e3a-9510-846758f78edc

	- https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Saugher-Nojan-2019-2020-Fellowship-Research-Infographic-1.pdf

	- Student surveys are a weak representation of the student body

		- They are voluntary

- Where the UC's have not seen data improvement, they sought to change the way data was gathered rather than reform the Title VI feedback cycle

	- Important questions have been made optional

	- Prior to being optional UCUES indicates

		- Discrimination issues persist

		- Students don't know how to report

## Conclusion

- Big picture: When Netanyahu went to D.C. the Biden administration failed to condemn the antisemitic behavior. This sets a terrible example for the young citizens of the U.S. 

	- Who is there to set an example? Throw in the argument about higher institutional "hands-off" philosophy and whether it should be so literally applied to undergraduates

		- https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media.

- Call to Action: Highlight the need for stronger independent oversight and policy changes to ensure accountability

	- The OCR office continues to shrink and is little more than a complaint box 

		- House committee hearing 

	- The OCR tolerance thresholds need to be re-examined

		- Dear colleague letters 

	- Open OCR cases against UCLA

		- Several cases have been pending while incidents keep happening

	- Like Title IX, Title VI should be expanded, and mandatory

	- Surveys (Title VI and Title IX) should be separate, and mandatory

		- UCUES is too long and covers too much at once

	- It seems like there should be 

		- Better rules for UCPD and campus security to follow regarding expelling non-affiliates from campus when rules are broken

		- Permanent bans from campus for violent offenders

	- But also, who is holding UCLA accountable for not carrying out perfectly good non-affiliate policies already in place?
