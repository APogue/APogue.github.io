### Lawsuit 3

- [Lawsuit 3](https://www.aclusocal.org/en/news/ucla-suppressed-student-and-faculty-freedom-speech-so-we-sued-them)

- [Actual filing](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/blair_v_regents_complaint.pdf)

- [Announcement](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBb7iDJy7PT/?hl=en)

- "The ACLU’s argument here likely hinges on distinguishing between **policy-based disruptions that affect university operations and those that impact free speech rights.** They might argue that while the university can regulate based on time, place, and manner to address genuine operational disruptions, **declaring an unlawful assembly solely based on “suspicion” of a policy violation—without imminent or actual disruption—risks suppressing lawful protest.**

	In essence, the ACLU would be pushing for stricter standards (probable cause and the presence of imminent violence or disruption) to prevent the university from prematurely declaring assemblies “unlawful,” emphasizing that **not all policy violations justify breaking up a protest if it doesn't clearly interfere with essential university functions.**"

- [California Penal Code Sec. 407](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=407#:~:text=Whenever%20two%20or%20more%20persons,assembly%20is%20an%20unlawful%20assembly.)

	- "**Whenever two or more persons assemble together to do an unlawful act, or do a lawful act in a violent, boisterous, or tumultuous manner, such assembly is an unlawful assembly.**"

- [California Penal Code Sec. 409](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=409.#:~:text=Every%20person%20remaining%20present%20at,is%20guilty%20of%20a%20misdemeanor.)

	- "**Every person remaining present at the place of any riot, rout, or unlawful assembly, after the same has been lawfully warned to disperse, except public officers and persons assisting them in attempting to disperse the same, is guilty of a misdemeanor**."

- Key points regarding the above

	- "Intent and Purpose: For an assembly to be deemed unlawful under these sections, there must be evidence of intent to engage in unlawful activities."

	- "Immediate Threat: The use of force or dispersal orders typically requires an immediate threat of violence or disruption." "

		1. Lack of Justifiable Cause: If there was indeed no criminal activity or intent within the encampment, the declaration of an unlawful assembly may lack legal grounding under Penal Code Sections 407 and 409.

		2. Broad Application of Dispersal Orders: Issuing a dispersal order without specific evidence or targeting can be viewed as an overreach of authority, potentially infringing on First Amendment rights related to free speech and assembly.

		3. Policy vs. Law Confusion: The initial message combined "unlawful" (a legal term) with "violates university policy," which, as previously discussed, can create confusion about the basis for enforcement actions.

		4. Due Process Concerns: Arresting individuals without clear evidence of wrongdoing or violating established procedures can raise due process issues, potentially leading to claims of wrongful arrest or suppression of free expression."

- With respect to blockading "

	1. Probable Cause:

		Requirement: Law enforcement must have reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed a specific offense. Application: Must be able to identify and articulate the individual actions that warrant arrest.

	2. Individual Responsibility:

		Principle: Each person is responsible for their own actions. Associating someone with a group activity does not justify arrest unless they are actively participating in wrongdoing.

	3. First Amendment Rights:

		Freedom of Assembly: Protects the right to gather peacefully. Limitations: Does not protect activities that violate laws or disrupt public order, such as blocking essential pathways.

	4. Clear Communication:

		Before Action: Universities should clearly communicate the specific behaviors that are prohibited and the consequences for violating those rules.

	5. Proportional Response:

		Enforcement: Actions taken should be proportionate to the severity of the disruption. Initial steps might include warnings or requests to disperse before escalating to arrests.

	6. Documentation and Evidence:

		Requirement: Authorities should document instances of disruption and ensure there is evidence linking specific individuals to the disruptive behavior."

	7. Obstruction of Public Pathways: 

		Blocking pathways can violate local ordinances or state laws related to obstruction, trespassing, or public safety. Individuals actively engaging in such behavior can be arrested based on these violations.

	8. Intent: 

		Proving intent is crucial. If participants can be shown to have knowingly obstructed pathways with the intent to disrupt university operations, this strengthens the case for their arrest.

	9. Due Process: 

		Any arrests must adhere to due process, ensuring that individuals are informed of the reasons for their arrest and have the opportunity to contest it.

	10. Evidence Collection: 

		Authorities must have clear evidence linking specific individuals to the obstructive actions to justify arrests.

	11. Proportional Response: 

		Enforcement actions should be proportionate to the severity of the disruption. Initial steps might include warnings or dispersal orders before escalating to arrests.

	12. Lack of Intent: 

		Participants might argue they did not intend to disrupt operations or that the encampment's actions were non-violent and within their rights to assemble.

	13. Policy Clarity: 

		If the policy to block pathways was not clearly communicated or was ambiguous, participants might contest their liability.

- The argument with respect to **disciplinary action by the university, Pp. 25**

	- This relates to Asil Yassin (LA Times)

		- [Police arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian students in L.A. The fallout continues, Aug. 2, 2024](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-02/ucla-usc-pomona-palestinian-protests)

		- "Yassine signed an agreement with UCLA to not violate its policies again, which lifted the hold on her records. But she still has not received her diploma or transcript.

		“I don’t think the arrests will lead to charges against me but the cases are still in limbo over my head,” Yassine said. “But the degree issue will set back my license by at least six months.”"


	- This is inconsistent with how the Title IX office would arrive upon a resolution, and presumably it's the same for a violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code. Offices receiving reports must conduct their own investigation---students have a right to due process. 

	- "179. The notice stated that Ms. Washington must schedule a meeting with Mr. Murotake “to
	discuss the above allegations,” and that “no degree may be conferred until any pending allegations
	and any assigned sanctions and conditions have been completed.”"

	- "according to UCPD, “[o]n May 2, 2024, you refused to leave an area of Royce Quad between Powell Library and Royce Hall, despite multiple dispersal orders issued by UCPD.” It alleged that this conduct violated three provisions of the UCLA Student Conduct Code, including the provisions against disorderly behavior, disturbing the peace, and failure to comply. "

	- "183. Mr. Murotake informed Ms. Washington that the Office does not have any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing against her and maintains no information about her arrest."

	- "184. He admitted that he was not empowered to decide on Ms. Washington’s case because there
	was “lots going on behind the scenes with the administration.”"

	- "185. During the meeting, Ms. Washington did not admit wrongdoing, complained that the Office
	had no facts to support any charges against her, and requested the proceeding be dropped. 186. Mr. Murotake ended the meeting stating that when a student denies the conduct, he must continue the investigation. He conceded, however, that the Office “does not have much to go off of” or any potential witnesses, and that he has to “wait to hear from the administration” about what it wants to do."

	- "188. The next day, Ms. Washington received an “Agreement of Resolution” for the disciplinary charge. It again wrongly accused Ms. Washington of violating the Student Code of Conduct, specifically the sections prohibiting disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, and failure to comply. It requested that, in exchange for Ms. Washington not to be subjected to any additional sanction (other than the opening of the disciplinary file itself and its continued allegations of the misconduct), that Ms. Washington agree for the remainder of her time as a student to:" (see doc for conditions)

	- "189. The Agreement also stated that the university is continuing to investigate what occurred on
	May 1 and May 2, and that Ms. Washington could still be subjected to further proceedings if it finds
	any additional evidence of misconduct. 190. “Additional” evidence is, however, misleading, because the university never presented Ms. Washington with any evidence of her alleged misconduct. 191. The Agreement also stated that any violation of the Agreement’s terms in the future would entitle the university not only to discipline her for that future violation, but also to re-open the original charges against Ms. Washington arising out of May 1 and May 2 and to further sanction her for those past incidents."

	- "193. The Agreement is now part of Ms. Washington’s student record and will be maintained by the Office of Student Conduct for five years from the date of the letter. 194. Ms. Washington now also faces the possibility that her disciplinary file could be reopened at any time. 195. Ms. Washington signed the Agreement of Resolution on July 25, 2024. She did so without admitting to any wrongdoing or violation of the Student Code of Conduct."


- The argument with respect to their arrest in the first place,

	- "227. Defendants unlawfully and without legal justification caused the arrest of Plaintiffs Graeme
	Blair and Catherine Washington on May 2, 2024."

	- "228. Defendants caused and effectuated the arrest of Plaintiffs without a warrant and without
	probable cause."

	- "229. Defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Plaintiffs because there was no underlying
	criminal offense that could justify the unlawful assembly declaration, which was based solely on
	violations of university policy, not on the existence of criminality, violence, or the clear and present
	danger of imminent violence, as required under California law. See In re Brown, 9 Cal. 3d at 624 (“An unlawful act within the meaning of section 407 . . . means criminal conduct prohibited by state
	law.”)."

	- "230. Because the unlawful assembly declaration was itself unlawful, there was no probable cause
	to arrest for failure to disperse under California Penal Code section 409, which applies only when an
	individual has been “lawfully warned to disperse.”"

	- "231. Moreover, when Defendants arrested Plaintiffs, they failed to make any effort to distinguish
	between the participants in any unlawful activity and innocent bystanders, as required to carry out a
	lawful arrest for failure to disperse under Penal Code section 409. See Dubner v. City & Cnty. of San
	Francisco, 266 F.3d 959, 967 (9th Cir. 2001)."

- Events surrounding April 30th

	- Whether the school opts to divest or not, and whatever the reason for why there was divestment in the past versus now are irrelevant to what I care about

	- Looks like the counter-protesters were only there to harass students (see 87.)

		- "88. **As the harassers turned violent on the evening of April 28, UCLA administrators did not
		intervene and offered no support to the students inside the otherwise nonviolent encampment. 89. As a result, increasingly larger numbers of individuals harassed, attacked, and attempted to
		dismantle the encampment at UCLA on the evenings of April 29 and April 30.**"

	- "100. **One demonstrator asked a UCLA-hired security guard why they were not assisting the victims of the violence. The guard responded that what those in the encampment were facing was their own fault**."

	- "I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,’ they said. ‘I’ve never heard any of my friends scream like that before. … It’s still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.’”"

	- "102. The same report described another student who was hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment’s barricade and their fellow students. This student “said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples. ‘I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,’ the student recalled.”

	- "103. Later reports confirmed that twenty-five pro-Palestine protesters were hospitalized because of injuries inflicted by mob violence."

	- "111. When pushed, he said it was because of “the people that attacked you last night,” saying “[t]he point is to shut down an unsafe situation because we think the people [referring to the mob] are going to come back and we don’t know how many may come back.” 

	- "115. UC and UCLA administrators did not need to shut down the encampment to protect
	individuals inside from future mob activity. They enjoyed ample resources, time, and wherewithal to develop a plan to discourage harassment and violent attacks against the encampment through a
	combination of physical barriers, security, and de-escalation tactics."

- UCLA community response

	- "142. A group of 86 UCLA School of Law faculty and staff members issued a statement “strongly
	condemn[ing] the violent attack on UCLA students by a mob of outsiders unaffiliated with UCLA”
	along with “the university’s failure to take the steps necessary to protect our students’ peaceful
	protest, despite the administration’s being on notice well before April 30 of the imminent risk of
	serious violence against the students in the encampment.” The faculty and staff issued a list of
	requests of the administration, including a complete investigation into its handling of the events,
	assistance to the victims of the mob violence, and to work with faculty “to develop strategies that
	allow protests and counter-protests to occur safely in the future.” "

	- "143. a cohort of 76 UCLA Jewish faculty and staff released a statement calling for,
	among other things, “the university to ensure that all students, faculty, and staff who were arrested
	for being part of or in solidarity with the encampment are provided with full amnesty and are assured
	that they will not be targeted again by UCLA or any UC administrators for engaging in peaceful
	protest.”"

	- "144. Faculty from the Department of Comparative Literature issued a statement stating that “[t]he
	university has not only failed to protect those rights of free expression; it has actively hindered them,
	 our students and colleagues vulnerable to assault and arrest, and breached the trust of the
	campus community.”"

	- "145. A group of 46 UCLA library staff echoed these statements, describing how “[t]he
	University’s inaction for hours while students in the encampment were attacked by a violent mob of
	counter protesters is especially horrifying given the overwhelming police force that was summoned
	the following day” to clear the encampment. They noted that “[r]egardless of your views on the
	encampment, this response [to forcibly clear the encampment] is abhorrent and at odds with principles—such as freedom of expression and student safety—that should be fundamental to any university campus. It sends a message that future protests are vulnerable to campus-approved suppression by either a mob or law enforcement.”"

	- "146. In another statement, members of the UCLA Mathematics Department wrote that they
	“condemn the conduct of our university administration to the student-led demonstrations protesting
	violence against Palestinians in Gaza,” noting that “[i]ndependent of our political views, we find the
	administration’s response shameful in its failure to protect our students and their freedom of
	expression.” The statement describes how “the administration used [the mob] violence against the
	protestors to justify clearing the protestors by force,” and demanded that the administration release
	an explanation for why it took its speech-suppressive actions."

	- "147. A larger petition signed by 906 UCLA faculty members decried the “violent and aggressive
	police sweep” of the encampment and the arrest of “more than 200 students, faculty, and staff
	arrested while peacefully protesting.” The petition asked that then-Chancellor Block resign, that
	UCLA recommend charges against those arrested be dropped, and that UCLA disclose and divest
	from investments in “military weapons production companies and supporting systems, in dialogue
	with the demands of the student protestors."

### Free speech precedent 

- [Legal precedent explained](https://freespeech.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/core-policies/protected-speech-discrimination-and-harassment#:~:text=Otherwise%20known%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9CFighting,Mason%20Univ.%2C%201991)

	- Like Title IX, legal precedent has significantly narrower protections 

		- "In higher education, the harassing behavior (including speech) must be of a kind that is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institutions’ resources and opportunities.” (Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 1999)."

	- UCLA may not be liable legally, but under Title VI it has an obligation to respond

		- "For almost 3 decades, Title IX has effectively been broader than the Davis standard “because the Department also believes a broader standard is appropriate to enforce Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in the administrative context, in which educational access is the goal and private damages are not at issue.”" (from updates to Title IX doc)

	- "We called on the Chancellor to take responsibility for this failure and take steps immediately against the counter protesters. We stated to the Chancellor, who wrote about Jewish students existing in a state of anxiety and fear
	despite the considerable violence directed at anyone speaking out against the genocide, that his
	emphasis on Jewish students feelings about Palestinian solidarity on the campus was serving to
	inflame the situation and embolden attacks on the Palestinian Solidarity Encampment. When we met with Chancellor Block on May 1, ostensibly to discuss with EVCP Hunt the considerable violence against the students, and to inform the chancellor that his remarks about Jewish students’ fear and discomfort serve to authorize counter protesters and to frame the students as violent, UCLA had already decided to clear the encampment. In the ensuing police response, many students were physically hurt by police and over 200 students, staff, and faculty were arrested and charged (see below). We have documented multiple injuries from rubber bullets and police batons"

	- Looks like the authors are university professors, [Gaye Theresa Johnson](https://afam.ucla.edu/person/gaye-theresa-johnson/)

	- The letter goes through the students' intentions wrt the protest on June 10th

	- "Chancellor Block created the office unilaterally, without a search, a vetting process, faculty or 
	staff input—and not even a consideration that Braziel’s appointment might be temporary or 
	interim. "

	- Pp. 6 costs of policing 

	- Pp. 11 laws around aiming projectiles to disperse crowds

	- Based on video footage the description of police brutality is exaggerated 

	- "Then at one point a UCPD officer shot a student in the chest with a rubber bullet from a distance of 
	about five feet away, surely a violation of the rules for the use of such armaments, which can be 
	lethal at such ranges. The force of the bullet knocked them down and two fellow students assisted 
	them to safety through the bushes. The student suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised 
	lung and was taken by car to the ER at Ronald Reagan Hospital. They remained there for two 
	days given the severity of the injury, which caused elevated cardiac enzymes. This situation could 
	have ended with a permanent disability or death and is a stark reminder of why it is so dangerous 
	to simply transfer control of campus to a militarized police force. Other students were injured as 
	well, one suffering from a concussion, others from bruises and lacerations.3"

		- "UCLA Associate professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student had to go to the hospital after they were hit with a rubber bullet. 

			“They were shot in the chest from 10-15 feet range,” Blair told The Hill."

		- "Many eyewitness reports, including the experiences of several Dodd Hall occupants, as well as documentary video and photographic evidence, support the claim that the violence was incited by police and security, rather than the protesting students."

	- [Footage here shows the kettling](https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1800640869869228490?s=46&t=fKh9XATL-WMti11DkcbvEg) on June 10th

	- The above doc said they were given a dispersal order then kettled. The police press release does say they essentially moved the students around the campus. 

	- Braziel mentioned the best way to conceal security forces would be to put them in blue in gold polo shirts and hide them in buildings, this would effectively make campus feel more like campus. Clearly professors find that disruptive. 

### Independent reviews

- [Two major reports slam UCLA over policing, violence at pro-Palestinian protest](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-01/ucla-usc-encampments-police-commission-reports)

	- [Antisemitism on college campuses exposed](https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/10.30.24_committee_on_education_and_the_workforce_republican_staff_report_-_antisemitism_on_college_campuses_exposed.pdf)

	- [University of California Los Angeles Campus Protest After-Action Report](https://www.lapdpolicecom.lacity.org/110524/BPC_24-285.pdf)

		- "The investigation into LAPD's response revealed LAPD had a limited role in the events on campus. Although there were minor uses of force by LAPD personnel, in general the LAPD's role was to support UCLA Police Department (UCLAPD) and provide for the personal safety and security of the UCLAPD and California Highway Patrol (CHP) around the perimeter of the protests."

		- The first part of the document goes into a Memorandum of agreement, which sounds a lot like LAPD is holding a grudge because UCLA "distanced themselves from the LAPD" and would not permit them to use UCLA property for any protest-related activity. Feels like they are insinuating UCLA "brought this upon themselves" through 1. No LAPD allowed to use UCLA property 2. UCLA doesn't want "police presence" at protests 3. UCLA has a separate set of values they promote with regard to the treatment of peaceful protesters 4. There was a predetermined way that UCLA could ask LAPD for assistance. 

		- April 28. 2024

			"The encampment grows to approximately 150 tents and 400 to 500 protesters.

			By 10:41 a.m. calls for service from community members begin to come in regarding the protestors and counter-protestors clashing. Approximately 10 calls from community members are generated during the day related to the protest. While a small group of LAPD personnel are on campus and available to assist UCLAPD if needed, LAPD remains uninvolved in the protest. **By 3:13 p.m., UCLAPD, Beverly Hills Police Department, Culver City Police Department, and Santa Monica Police Department clear the counter-protestors from the other areas on campus and the Zone encampment remains**." ---The below report from 21 solutions indicates that UCPD were made aware of the April 28th permit, looks like they were prepared.  

		- April 29. 2024

			"The encampment remains on campus and no issues arise until close to midnight. **At 11:49 p.m.,UCLAPD requests assistance from LAPD**. Units from LAPD are dispatched and begin to arrive at UCLA at 12:11 a.m. However, at 12:16 a.m., UCLAPD cancels the request for LAPD personnel. Shortly after that, all LAPD units leave the campus."

		- April 30, 2024

			"At 6:27 p.m., the first community member calls LAPD Communications Division to report violence on the campus and the information is given to UCLAPD to handle. At approximately 11:00 p.m., 911 calls from the community related to the protest begin to pick up. At 11:07 p.m., Commander Lurie receives information from Chief Thomas and Lieutenant Chobanian about UCLAPD being overwhelmed by the crowd; however, it is not until 11:31 p.m. that UCLAPD requests mutual aid through Communications Division.

			Between 6:27 p.m. and midnight, 19 community member 911 calls were received by LAPD
			Communications Division related to violence or fireworks on campus; however, some of those
			were placed by community members that were watching the events on television or social media."

		- May 1, 2024

			"By 12:11 a.m. the first mutual aid units arrive on campus. At 1:14 a.m., Commander Lurie arrives on campus and begins coordinating with CHP and UCLAPD on a plan to break up the clashing protestors. **By 1:41 a.m., three Mobile Field Force (MFF) squads were assembled with officers from CHP and LAPD**." ---This was Newsom and Karen Bass.
			
			"By 1:44 a.m., the MFF squads meet the protestors and begin to separate the pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli crowds near the flagpole; however, **they take no further action to clear the crowds because they are coordinating a plan and waiting for more resources to arrive. The squads remain at the flagpole for approximately one-hour.** 
			
			Basic crowd control tactics dictate that entering a crowd without enough resources to make arrests, properly secure critical points, and avoid being overwhelmed by the crowd is dangerous for the public and officers. Therefore, it was imperative that sufficient personnel were assembled prior to further entry into the crowd. ---The journalists didn't have a problem with crowd density at all. 

			By 1:51 a.m., an additional 21 calls from community members were received by LAPD Communications Division (at least seven of which were placed by community members who were watching the events on television or social media).

			At 2:43 a.m., the CHP began to clear the rest of the Royce Hall courtyard near the encampment **since more officers continued to arrive**. By 3:48 a.m., the courtyard was cleared of protestors, but the encampment was allowed to remain."

		- **UCLA failed to protect students from protest fallout in spring because of “chaotic” decision making and other shortcomings, an independent review found.**

		- "The review found that UCLA had no detailed plan for handling major protests, even as problems were “reasonably foreseeable” as encampments springing up at other campuses were drawing at times violent conflict. UCLA leaders had not identified who should control decision-making and at times shut out campus police from meetings."

		- "“Because no codified plans existed, UCLA administrators engaged in a chaotic process in which they needed to make difficult decisions ... in the midst of ongoing disruption, without clarity on who maintained final decision-making authority, lacking a commonly understood process for reaching decisions, and largely lacking the ability to react quickly to fast-changing events and dynamic circumstances on campus,” the report by 21st Century Policing Solutions concluded."

		- "UC President Michael V. Drake said in a statement Thursday that the goal of the UCLA review was to learn what reforms were needed to prevent a recurrence of the shortcomings, while safeguarding campus health and safety, **equal access to educational facilities and 1st Amendment rights to free speech**."

		- “This central tension — whether and how police provide public safety, and for whom — is part of a national conversation about the role of police and the meaning of public safety,” the review said. “UCLA has thus far responded to this tension ineffectively, by functionally excluding police from planning and engagement but then asking law enforcement to engage once tensions have escalated to violence.”

		- "One group of senior administrators excluded UCLA police and sowed frustration by the ”free-flowing debate, internecine conflict, and a notable lack of decision-making.”"

		- The UC systemwide community safety plan calls for “tiered responses” to protests, with law enforcement brought in as a last resort, but police were “almost entirely uninvolved” in decision-making.

		- Campus police, for instance, were not consulted when UCLA approved a permit for a pro-Israel rally to be set up next to the encampment two days before the melee. Police might have been able to warn about the potential danger of dueling protest groups next to each other; physical skirmishes did break out between them.

		- The article also goes into the antisemitism and anti-muslim,etc reports

			- “This report clearly delineates numerous and frequent instances of faculty who violated the rules and joined the encampments or made comments in their classrooms that were not consistent with rules ... yet the report indicates that not one faculty member was disciplined by the Academic Senate. That seems intolerable to me and has to change,” he said.

				In response, Academic Senate Chair Steven W. Cheung told regents that faculty disciplinary processes were meant to “protect our due diligence rights, our rights to a hearing, and to make sure we are deliberative in our decision-making.” He said the Senate was not interested in “fossilized” processes and would welcome reviewing them with the regents.

			- "Regent Jay Sures grilled UCLA Interim Chancellor Darnell Hunt on the campus administration’s progress in **investigating allegations of antisemitic, anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim incidents since Oct. 7**, 2023, which Hunt said were in the **“hundreds” on “both sides.”**"

- Notes

	- Even under circumstances where no plans were in place, there were no efforts at hostile environment mitigation, they blamed the UCPD Chief, and they made up the Rick Braziel role without proper due diligence, his role is also not what they originally stated

	- hired and controlled scolding 

	- no identities revealed, vague references to "senior administrators"

	- short window of policy coverage, end of May to beginning of April 

	- when they make references to improper conduct, they are not always specific with regards to which events

	- Multiple references to the Robinson-Edley Report 

	- Basically Wade was correct 

	- They blamed literally all parties involved but senior administration---Eli Tsives, parents and the greater community, protesters, chaos of the situation, bad or nonexistent policy, literally everyone. It looks like a carefully constructed document for vague accountability measures and policy suggestions with targeted explanations using blame shifting for serious security failures sprinkled in. Aka they are using accountability and policy suggestions as a vehicle for the explanation of serious failures with carefully chosen parties to burden the blame. 

	- The police were largely blamed for a failure in following proper mutual aid protocols. Otherwise the document seeks to largely exonerate them.

	- The end of the article uses vague policy platitudes to direct blame at "UCLA," (who is UCLA?) but it is clear what they are implying. 

- **Administrative failures**

	- **Policy**

		- "2012’s Robinson-Edley report sets forth substantial research and specific recommendations for UC campuses."

		- "UCLA has not effectively formalized or operationalized these recommendations, leading the University and administrators to repeat mistakes in April and May 2024 that the 2012 Robinson-Edley recommendations were designed to reduce."

		- Tiered Response Matrix "November 8, 2023 version of the plan set forth high-level principles to guide decision-making, for example that law enforcement would only be actively engaged when the activity in question “presents an imminent danger” – including an event “that is posing imminent risk to safety and health and significant risk to safety and health and significant disruption to university functions.”""

		- "However, it is not clear whether this Matrix was formally adopted, and our review indicated that it was not readily available to decision-makers."

		- "Beyond this high-level Matrix document, UCLA did not, at the time of the encampment, have any plans for how to respond to campus disruptions and how decisions about University responses would be made.4 Because no codified plans existed, UCLA administrators engaged in a chaotic process in which they needed to make difficult decisions – 
		some appearing to be matter of first impression for many involved – "

		- "During the encampment period, two groups of stakeholders mobilized and met regularly to respond to the encampment and related protests and counter-protests. However, the role of each group was not well-established or commonly understood; there were not clear processes for decision-making; and it was not clear who had authority for final decision-making. Combined with the lack of prior planning for such an event, **even when an encampment of this sort was reasonably foreseeable based on events at other campuses both nationally and locally**, this resulted in some institutional paralysis, a highly chaotic decision making environment, and ultimately, an inability to effectively respond and protect students from violence."

		- Columbia arrested 100 on April 30th to clear their encampment, supposedly flash bangs but no tear gas or rubber bullets. [NYT article about Columbia protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/nyregion/columbia-protests-arrest-agitators-israel.html)

		- Suggests the Incident Command System (ICS), cross-check this with Wade, Community Safety Plan, and Robinson-Edely (Policy Doc)---checked Robinson-Edely and Wade and both mention it by name

		- The report introduces the **ICS as if no one has heard of it before**. Wade and UCLA policy referred to it by name. 

		- "**UCLA should formally use ICS in its response to emergencies and disruptions on campus, and its plans for response should be based on the ICS system**. While UCLA’s comprehensive adoption of ICS within the context of all campus incidents that implicate safety will take time,8 UCLA should immediately develop plans for response to reasonably foreseeable campus disruptions and situations that incorporate some of the key components of the Incident Command System. Critically, the plans and response should clearly identify, and ensure, an Incident Commander who has overall authority for managing the entire incident, including responsibility over the overall incident safety and providing information to internal and external stakeholders"

	- **Communication**

		- "Recommendation 1.6: UCLA should maintain, in the short- and intermediate-term, clearer  mechanisms for ensuring that information is appropriately shared during an incident to those who need it. "

		- "Beyond the IRT and EMPG meetings, information was dispersed through informal means, such as through text messages and ad hoc meetings of varying groups of senior administrators. In some instances, it appears that key information may not have been clearly provided to decision-makers. "

		- Suggest having a "situation room" they're calling the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in order to centralize internal comms with all stakeholders. 

		- "Although UCLA has technically maintained structures and physical space allocated to an EOC, the emergency management function at UCLA, which is responsible for the EOC, has tended to be **under-resourced and marginalized**. During the encampment period, a true Emergency Center was not, as noted previously, established until May. Even when that EOC was finally activated, it was [not] utilized to its full potential, in part **because key leaders tend to send other personnel as proxies – minimizing the value of the EOC because central authorities were not present.**"

		- "Primary Recommendation 4: UCLA should address and enhance its ability to share information, and share
		information to community stakeholders, during and after critical incidents."

		-  "Because UCLA did not have a clear plan for responding to the encampment, it was **unable to provide information to students, their parents, legislators, the press, and other stakeholders about how it planned to respond**."

		- "Our review of emails and other electronic communications revealed that, once the encampment was established, **administrators were bombarded with questions from within and outside the UCLA community about how it planned to respond**." ---the answer is clear, free speech is protected on campus, period. By coddling alarmists over discrimination or antisemitism or whatever, they are effectively conceding their point, that they only protect free speech when it is the right kind, otherwise it is a "problem" that needs addressing. 

		- "**Particularly after social media posts about Jewish students being excluded from portions of campus went viral, administrators were inundated with complaints and concerns from parents, politicians, and community members about why the University was allowing it to continue.**" ---parents and Eli are now getting blamed, they did not make it clear to the protesters what needed changing, and did not then relate that the situation was handled to the greater community. What they did was complain then try to shut down the encampment, without a clear reason as to why. This left protesters upset and confused and the greater community inflamed.  

		- "**Administrators, including communications professionals, scrambled to respond**. As with other aspects of the University’s response, it was often unclear who the final decision-makers were, which led to some conflict between administrators and communications professionals." ---this is so vague

		- **At the same time, the lack of clear response objectives and plans led to a muddled communication response that, at times, prioritized optics over other interests.** ---Calling bullshit on this. Correlation is not necessarily causation. There were other instances devoid of chaos where they had the opportunity to handle things in a content-neutral manner, and they did not. 

		- "Following resolution of an incident of campus disruption, UCLA should provide information to stakeholders to explain what happened, why the University took the action it did."

		- "The investigation identified a fair amount of misunderstanding and misreporting about what happened within both the University and broader communities, contributing in some instances to unnecessary frustration and anger." ---this is not constructive or useful it is incredibly vague. 

	- **UCPD**

		- "At the same time, administrators lacked knowledge of basic police techniques and technology, the resources and personnel available to the Police Department, and the Incident command System that should have been operationalized during an emergency. Again, this created a frenzied decision-making process and left University leaders ill-equipped to guide and gauge the level of police intervention, **including by influencing the techniques used, timing the intervention to reduce the need for force and arrest**, and ensuring sufficient police were available to stop violence and protect public safety."

			- Influencing the techniques used (why are munitions only used on students?) timing the intervention to reduce the risk of violence as well 

		- "... ensure that plans align with the **University’s values**, and can increase the likelihood of an effective response consistent with **University objectives**."

		- "The goal is for administrators and safety personnel in a crisis to be able to focus on implementing previously codified plans and decision-making processes rather than **thinking through issues as a matter of first impression during a time of crisis**" --this is a means to reflexively implement safety protocols irrespective of the assumed level of threat. This way they can always ensure safety and security. This is perhaps meant to safeguard against negligent behavior, or worse, reckless behavior (inciting violence)---not only were their **first instincts terrible with respect to the perceived level of threat, they defaulted to a state where they did not care about how things were being managed, and they acted irresponsibly from a rhetorical standpoint effectively putting students in harms way**--- all boils down to a total failure of leadership. 

			- not only eliminating chaos and impromptu decision making, but attempting to eliminate the need for competent leadership

			- really there were several opportunities to mitigate risk---take the perceived level of threat seriously, arbitrarily step up security, or change messaging to the greater community. The administration failed on all three fronts. How can that be an accident? 

			- hugely irresponsible given the size of these protests; there was a lack of authority taken from the people with the true intel with respect to ensuring the safety of these protesters. To put it plainly, if you want something done right you do it yourself esp. if there's any ambiguity in the situation. Any real leader would takeover at the risk of overstepping their boundaries. In unknown territory to delegate during chaos, knowing full well that people cannot do their jobs due to lack of intel etc, comes at the the peril of the leader and those they are trying to protect. 

			- they didn't reprimand growing tension from counter-protesters

			- when it came time to reprimand anyone, in the same fashion as before, they reprimanded the pro-Palestinian protesters only---effectively inciting violence

			- violence which they were then unprepared for because no one stepped up in a time of crisis. 

		- "Throughout UCLA’s response to the encampment, there was **significant confusion** regarding commitments that had been made regarding securing assistance from other police departments, the type and level of assistance that would be provided, and the length of time it would take for resources to arrive. This confusion was caused, in part, by the lack of decision-making by administrators and the lack of detailed operation plans, as described above, and by communication challenges between law enforcement and the administration."

		- "Ultimately, however, **a substantial cause of the overall confusion** stemmed from the UCLA Police Department’s own confusion about mutual aid and the process for obtaining law enforcement assistance from other departments."

			- So confusing, who is at fault?

		- "The decision whether to issue a permit for an event on campus and the parameters of the permitted activity should involve all reasonably affected campus entities and stakeholders, including law enforcement. However, the investigation learned that **the standard process for issuing a permit does require consultation with the police but that, in practice, this consultation does not routinely occur**."

		- "UCLA Police Department ofcials told the investigative team that they were not consulted before a permit was issued for the counter-protest on April 28."

		- "Had they been consulted, they may have been able to alert administrators to **the danger of the two protest groups being so close to one another**, and to the danger that a third protest group—counter-counter-protesters, in this case— could enter the permitted event from the back side, creating a volatile situation. Instead, UCLA PD reports it was not informed of the event until the permit already had been issued."

		- "As of this writing, the issue does not appear to have been entirely resolved. UCLA PD reports it still is not always being timely consulted on the decision of whether to issue permits or the parameters of permits."



- **Command structures** 

	- Two groups principally involved, the **IRT and the EMPG**

	- "One group that was convened to respond to the encampment was the Incident Response Team (“IRT”). The IRT meetings, held virtually, included a large number of campus stakeholders, including many who did not have formal decision-making roles. Although the IRT included police leadership, **key administrative leaders did not routinely attend the IRT’s meetings**."

	- "However, several senior administrators indicated to the investigative team that the **IRT was not a decision-making body** and that, instead, the purpose of IRT meetings was largely to disseminate information."

	- Side note: Office of Emergency Management was under Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck, both this office and UCPD then moved to the Office of Campus Safety (a day before Block's congressional hearing-he reassigned Beck and UCPD Chief John Thomas)

	- "They reported that the decision-making was done by the Emergency Management Planning Group."

	- "The Emergency Management Planning Group (“EMPG”) was a smaller group of senior administrators – primarily Vice Chancellors and a limited number of additional, senior personnel –"

	- "Like the IRT, it lacked clear leadership and decision-making processes. Meetings of the EMPG were characterized by free-flowing debate, internecine conflict, and a notable lack of decision-making"

	- "The meetings **did not include representation from the UCLA Police Department** – which was coordinating the response of police and civilian, private security – and lacked an efective mechanism to ensure the EMPG had key information from the Police Department"


- **UCPD**

	- "Crucially, the purpose of the IRT meetings was not clear to all members. UCLA PD personnel appeared to understand that the IRT was a decision-making body and were **frustrated by lack of clear leadership and direction** in the 			meetings."

	- "At least one IRT meeting was led by Vice Chancellor for Strategic Communications, leaving some other UCLA personnel and **police leadership to conclude, whether true or not, that public safety decisions were being made by the communications team** rather than leaders with law enforcement experience and expertise."

	- "The police were almost entirely uninvolved in decision-making – no one with extensive law enforcement management experience was present in the EMPG meetings to raise issues, provide feedback on proposed strategies, and gauge when and how police may be asked to intervene. This left law enforcement without a clear understanding of the University’s objectives, the principles upon which University leaders were making decisions, and University leadership’s balancing of implicated risks."

	- "The California Ofce of Emergency Services has developed a law enforcement mutual aid plan...Under that plan, UCLA PD is a member of the Area A platoon of the Los Angeles County Mutual Aid Organization. The Area A platoon includes the police departments of Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and Culver City. "

	- "These agreements should include commitments that UCLA PD will exercise command and control over all law enforcement actions on the UCLA campus, and that LAPD will abide by UCLA PD policies in providing support."

	- "Fundamental questions about the appropriate role of police on UCLA’s campus led to conflicting demands on law enforcement, ultimately leaving the Police Department ill-equipped to meet those demands.

		**This reinforced many community members’ view that police will not and cannot protect them – and that their presence automatically undermines community safety**."

	- They are blaming **a lack** of administrative direction wrt policing as the issue with regard to distrust in police presence thereby causing the administration to ensure police were not present at the encampment

		- **They need to address the possibility that it is not **a lack thereof** but ill-will towards these students that is driving policing policy on campus**. And that the problem can be specifically traced and remedied in large part by addressing the administrators in control. 

		- "Because of changing norms and evolving ideas around the meaning of public safety, including a strong feeling among **some community members that the presence of police contributes to a lack of safety, the UCLA Police Department has been asked to play a different role**." 

	- "This expectation that UCLA PD remain less visible and engaged with the community was demonstrated in UCLA’s response to the encampment.

		As discussed previously, encampment members made it clear throughout the encampment period that they did not want to engage with police or see police in or around the encampment, and the UCLA administration was responsive to these requests." ---more blame

	- "This approach to police presence, engagement, and involvement predated the encampment, which meant that the Police Department did not have relationships with students, faculty, campus organizations, and other community members in advance of the encampment.

		**This hampered UCLA PD’s ability to understand the evolving dynamics of the various protests and left it without the ability to leverage existing relationships of trust to work with protesters to develop agreements and processes to keep both those inside and outside the encampment safe.**"

	- "With the UCLA PD reporting that they were told to stay entirely off campus, while some administrators stated that the police were not told to stay off campus but rather to stay out of sight, there is general agreement across most accounts that police were instructed to remain wholly unseen by protesters." ---artful blame shifting 

	- "**UCLA PD was therefore handicapped in its ability to gain information about the encampment, its size, whether there were any weapons within the encampment, and whether protesters around the encampment were posing a growing danger to those within the encampment.**" ---"protesters around?"

	- "When administrators instructed the police department to engage, **the police lacked critical information that could have helped determine the lowest level of intervention necessary to accomplish its goals.**" ---Yeah, Thompson was on the couch at home watching the Dodgers

	- "UCLA has thus far responded to this tension ineffectively by **functionally excluding police from planning and engagement**, only to ask law enforcement to engage once tensions have escalated to violence."

	- "The University did, however, call on the police to intervene once administrators realized that the ongoing encampment and the presence of counter-protesters posed a safety risk to its students.

		By then, the encampment was large, and intervention required significant planning and personnel. This style of policing – where police are brought in only when there is violence or imminent physical violence to enforce the law, without prior engagement with community members, established relationships of trust to work with demonstrators, **or intelligence about safety threats – risks necessitating a higher level of police intervention**.

		**In this case, the results reinforced the view of some encampment members that police were not interested in protecting them but rather intervened solely to violently suppress their right to protest**." ---This should say "administrators" not "police."

	- "The failure to do so will continue to place **UCLA PD and other response resources in the nearly impossible situation of being excluded from campus safety conversations, responses, and planning until there are no other options – while being expected to perform flawlessly with less involvement, information, and community relationships than necessary to ensure successful outcomes.**"

	- "**UCLA may need to re-examine longstanding assumptions about policing and consider fundamental, significant changes to how communities ensure the well-being and safety of their members.**" ---Nail on the head here. This is saying, do you even know how a community works? Let alone being a manager or carrying out policy. 

	- "Whatever the result, UCLA must ensure clarity – **both within the administration and in outward communication** – regarding the role of the police to establish a responsive, equitable, and effective campus safety system for the future."


- **Security failures**

	- "Our review concluded that the UCLA Police Department lacked sufciently detailed plans for responding to oncampus emergencies requiring mutual aid, resulting in an ad hoc and inefective response when administrators asked the Police Department to engage. Indeed, the absence of advance tactical planning made the law enforcement response, when it was necessary on both April 28 and April 30, slower and more chaotic than it should have been. "

	- "When UCLA’s mutual aid partners responded to assist UCLA PD in response to the eruption of violence on the night of April 30, there were no plans to refer them to; UCLA PD did not exercise command and control over the law enforcement response; and there was not even an identified staging area to coordinate incoming support. Although UCLA PD personnel were present, no one from UCLA PD took command of the scene, and ofcials from the responding agencies described that it appeared no one was in charge."

	- Side note: Thomas said the LAPD were answering to their own Lieutenant 

	- "Within this context, as this report has described, the two main responding agencies, LAPD and CHP, were left to devise an ad hoc plan without guidance from UCLA PD."

	- "However, ofcers and leadership from these agencies were unfamiliar with the geography of the campus; had no information about who the protesters were or about the type of resistance officers might meet; and were not familiar with UCLA’s policies for **responding to campus disruptions or the values that guided them**. " ---this seems like they do not have a content-neutral approach. In any case, what were the values that guided them? 

	- The below statement is unclear, is this referring to the riot or the sweep? Because the coverage dates of this report are so narrow, it ignores evidence that mutual agencies mishandled protesters over *several* incidents, in other words, even when protests were not chaotic and out of hand requiring in the moment decision making, protesters were mishandled

	- "The lack of a clear plan and direction from UCLA PD also meant that the responding mutual aid agencies were not briefed on or otherwise familiar with UCLA policies regarding preferred techniques and tools for gaining compliance with police directives. Because UCLA PD did not provide this critical information, these outside law enforcement agencies *decided amongst themselves how to engage*. "


	- **Other security personnel** 
	
		- "Primary Recommendation 6: UCLA should ensure that a range of resources beyond sworn law enforcement are available to support community safety and to allow for a true tiered response aimed at matching the right response with the right community issue or problem."

		- "Consistent with University of California guidance, UCLA has **adopted a tiered response model to resolve incidents on its campus that violate community norms, University policy, or the law**. Under this model, UCLA attempts to address issues and resolve incidents without active engagement of law enforcement – only enlisting the active engagement of law enforcement when **certain thresholds have been met**, such as to prevent significant disruption to University operations or to protect health and safety. " ---address issues and resolve incidents?

		- Public Safety Aides (PSAs) and Campus Service Officers (CSOs), private security officers, and Student Affairs Mediators and Mitigators (SAMs). 

		- Public Safety Aides (PSAs)

			- "PSAs are stationed in University buildings, serve as a liaison between the police department and students, and can attempt to deescalate minor disruptions on campus. For the most part, however, PSAs observe conduct on campus and call sworn officers if they observe criminal or suspicious activity."

		- Campus Service Officers (CSOs)

			- "Meanwhile, campus Security Officers (“CSOs”) are students who work part-time for the UCLA police department. They provide escorts to students after hours,are stationed in University buildings, act as a liaison between students and the police department, and act as additional eyes and ears of the police department. LikePSAs, CSOs do not engage physically. If they observe criminal or suspicious activity, they hand the matter over to sworn police officers.14 "

		- private security officers

			- "They can help deter conduct by providing a physical presence, can provide direction about what is and is not permitted, and can help enforce boundaries by ensuring barriers remain in place and telling people where they are allowed to go. Beyond this, however, these unarmed security personnel also largely serve as observers– contacting police when they observe or suspect criminal activity. "

			- "Security officers were instructed to “observe and report.” Some evidence suggests that, when individuals observed violence or criminal activity and asked for help, security officers were not always helpful – either not responding at all or telling the person seeking assistance that they needed to all the police."---then they are a huge waste of money

		- Student Affairs Mediators and Mitigators (SAMs)

			- "Student Affairs Monitors and Student Affairs Mitigators, although both are referred to as “SAMs.”

			- "These employees do not work full-time as SAMs; rather, they are full-time employees who hold other positions but agree to add serving as a SAM to their other full-time responsibilities. 

			- There are approximately 20 Student Affairs Monitors who serve only as observers and reporters.
			There are also approximately **10 to 15 Student Affairs Mitigators, who intervene, provide warnings and information, and attempt to de-escalate situations**. Neither Monitors nor Mitigators are available around-the-clock." ---they are volunteers

			- "Numerous campus stakeholders indicated to this investigation that events on campus this spring made clear that having SAMs serve as the first engagement in a tiered response model works very well in the more typical scenarios described above – **but is ineffective and potentially inappropriate as a response to lengthy campus disruptions, disruptive behavior by non-students, and during encounters that may turn violent**."

			- "SAMs were dispatched to the encampment to try to deescalate tensions between protesters within and outside the encampment and to remind students of the rules.

				**However, non-students who were present had no reason to listen or respond to SAMs – they are unaffected by the threat of student discipline and have made no commitments to abiding by community norms**. 

				SAMs described that their attempts to engage with non-students were ignored or otherwise ineffective." ---UCLA should have this figured out by now. 

			- "SAMs were also ill-equipped to respond to some of the behaviors they encountered, and there were instances in which they felt unsafe.

				For example, as events unfolded on April 30, **SAMs were calling their supervisors, reporting that they heard explosives, that people were wearing masks, and that they did not know what to do**."

			- "One common refrain that surfaced during the investigation is that the University needs to develop interventions and resources that can be called upon when intervention by SAMs is inappropriate, unavailable, or ineffective – but where a law enforcement response is not yet necessary.

				**In short, UCLA asked its SAMs to shoulder too much of the response and security burden during the encampment**. Even beyond large-scale campus disturbances, asking SAMs to be the sole entity that responds to a host of campus issues beyond the police is logistically untenable in the long run."

		- With respect to the "tiered response" paradigm, UCLA only seems to want to use that with non-students, students get full-on police 

		- The recommendation: "This entity should be viewed as an integral component of UCLA’s campus safety ecosystem, directed by the Associate Vice Chancellor for Campus Safety.

			Its central role will focus on **avoiding the active engagement of sworn law enforcement** by working with the community to reduce campus safety risks, responding to developing incidents, and de-escalating them."

			---There is a lot of contrast between this and what Braziel envisions 

- Wasting money

	- This was supposed to be Braziel's report, they outsourced it (see Darnell Hunt's 4 point plan in "aftermath")
