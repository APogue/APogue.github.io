### Lawsuit 3

- [Lawsuit 3](https://www.aclusocal.org/en/news/ucla-suppressed-student-and-faculty-freedom-speech-so-we-sued-them)

- [Actual filing](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/blair_v_regents_complaint.pdf)

- [Announcement](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBb7iDJy7PT/?hl=en)

- "The ACLU’s argument here likely hinges on distinguishing between **policy-based disruptions that affect university operations and those that impact free speech rights.** They might argue that while the university can regulate based on time, place, and manner to address genuine operational disruptions, **declaring an unlawful assembly solely based on “suspicion” of a policy violation—without imminent or actual disruption—risks suppressing lawful protest.**

	In essence, the ACLU would be pushing for stricter standards (probable cause and the presence of imminent violence or disruption) to prevent the university from prematurely declaring assemblies “unlawful,” emphasizing that **not all policy violations justify breaking up a protest if it doesn't clearly interfere with essential university functions.**"

- [California Penal Code Sec. 407](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=407#:~:text=Whenever%20two%20or%20more%20persons,assembly%20is%20an%20unlawful%20assembly.)

	- "Whenever two or more persons assemble together to do an unlawful act, or do a lawful act in a violent, boisterous, or tumultuous manner, such assembly is an unlawful assembly."

- [California Penal Code Sec. 409](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=409.#:~:text=Every%20person%20remaining%20present%20at,is%20guilty%20of%20a%20misdemeanor.)

	- "Every person remaining present at the place of any riot, rout, or unlawful assembly, after the same has been lawfully warned to disperse, except public officers and persons assisting them in attempting to disperse the same, is guilty of a misdemeanor."

- Key points regarding the above

	- "Intent and Purpose: For an assembly to be deemed unlawful under these sections, there must be evidence of intent to engage in unlawful activities."

	- "Immediate Threat: The use of force or dispersal orders typically requires an immediate threat of violence or disruption." "

		1. Lack of Justifiable Cause: If there was indeed no criminal activity or intent within the encampment, the declaration of an unlawful assembly may lack legal grounding under Penal Code Sections 407 and 409.

		2. Broad Application of Dispersal Orders: Issuing a dispersal order without specific evidence or targeting can be viewed as an overreach of authority, potentially infringing on First Amendment rights related to free speech and assembly.

		3. Policy vs. Law Confusion: The initial message combined "unlawful" (a legal term) with "violates university policy," which, as previously discussed, can create confusion about the basis for enforcement actions.

		4. Due Process Concerns: Arresting individuals without clear evidence of wrongdoing or violating established procedures can raise due process issues, potentially leading to claims of wrongful arrest or suppression of free expression."

- With respect to blockading "

	1. Probable Cause:

		Requirement: Law enforcement must have reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed a specific offense. Application: Must be able to identify and articulate the individual actions that warrant arrest.

	2. Individual Responsibility:

		Principle: Each person is responsible for their own actions. Associating someone with a group activity does not justify arrest unless they are actively participating in wrongdoing.

	3. First Amendment Rights:

		Freedom of Assembly: Protects the right to gather peacefully. Limitations: Does not protect activities that violate laws or disrupt public order, such as blocking essential pathways.

	4. Clear Communication:

		Before Action: Universities should clearly communicate the specific behaviors that are prohibited and the consequences for violating those rules.

	5. Proportional Response:

		Enforcement: Actions taken should be proportionate to the severity of the disruption. Initial steps might include warnings or requests to disperse before escalating to arrests.

	6. Documentation and Evidence:

		Requirement: Authorities should document instances of disruption and ensure there is evidence linking specific individuals to the disruptive behavior."

	7. Obstruction of Public Pathways: 

		Blocking pathways can violate local ordinances or state laws related to obstruction, trespassing, or public safety. Individuals actively engaging in such behavior can be arrested based on these violations.

	8. Intent: 

		Proving intent is crucial. If participants can be shown to have knowingly obstructed pathways with the intent to disrupt university operations, this strengthens the case for their arrest.

	9. Due Process: 

		Any arrests must adhere to due process, ensuring that individuals are informed of the reasons for their arrest and have the opportunity to contest it.

	10. Evidence Collection: 

		Authorities must have clear evidence linking specific individuals to the obstructive actions to justify arrests.

	11. Proportional Response: 

		Enforcement actions should be proportionate to the severity of the disruption. Initial steps might include warnings or dispersal orders before escalating to arrests.

	12. Lack of Intent: 

		Participants might argue they did not intend to disrupt operations or that the encampment's actions were non-violent and within their rights to assemble.

	13. Policy Clarity: 

		If the policy to block pathways was not clearly communicated or was ambiguous, participants might contest their liability.

- The argument with respect to **disciplinary action by the university, Pp. 25**

	- This relates to Asil Yassin (LA Times)

		- [Police arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian students in L.A. The fallout continues, Aug. 2, 2024](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-02/ucla-usc-pomona-palestinian-protests)

		- "Yassine signed an agreement with UCLA to not violate its policies again, which lifted the hold on her records. But she still has not received her diploma or transcript.

		“I don’t think the arrests will lead to charges against me but the cases are still in limbo over my head,” Yassine said. “But the degree issue will set back my license by at least six months.”"


	- This is inconsistent with how the Title IX office would arrive upon a resolution, and presumably it's the same for a violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code. Offices receiving reports must conduct their own investigation---students have a right to due process. 

	- "179. The notice stated that Ms. Washington must schedule a meeting with Mr. Murotake “to
	discuss the above allegations,” and that “no degree may be conferred until any pending allegations
	and any assigned sanctions and conditions have been completed.”"

	- "according to UCPD, “[o]n May 2, 2024, you refused to leave an area of Royce Quad between Powell Library and Royce Hall, despite multiple dispersal orders issued by UCPD.” It alleged that this conduct violated three provisions of the UCLA Student Conduct Code, including the provisions against disorderly behavior, disturbing the peace, and failure to comply. "

	- "183. Mr. Murotake informed Ms. Washington that the Office does not have any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing against her and maintains no information about her arrest."

	- "184. He admitted that he was not empowered to decide on Ms. Washington’s case because there
	was “lots going on behind the scenes with the administration.”"

	- "185. During the meeting, Ms. Washington did not admit wrongdoing, complained that the Office
	had no facts to support any charges against her, and requested the proceeding be dropped. 186. Mr. Murotake ended the meeting stating that when a student denies the conduct, he must continue the investigation. He conceded, however, that the Office “does not have much to go off of” or any potential witnesses, and that he has to “wait to hear from the administration” about what it wants to do."

	- "188. The next day, Ms. Washington received an “Agreement of Resolution” for the disciplinary charge. It again wrongly accused Ms. Washington of violating the Student Code of Conduct, specifically the sections prohibiting disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, and failure to comply. It requested that, in exchange for Ms. Washington not to be subjected to any additional sanction (other than the opening of the disciplinary file itself and its continued allegations of the misconduct), that Ms. Washington agree for the remainder of her time as a student to:" (see doc for conditions)

	- "189. The Agreement also stated that the university is continuing to investigate what occurred on
	May 1 and May 2, and that Ms. Washington could still be subjected to further proceedings if it finds
	any additional evidence of misconduct. 190. “Additional” evidence is, however, misleading, because the university never presented Ms. Washington with any evidence of her alleged misconduct. 191. The Agreement also stated that any violation of the Agreement’s terms in the future would entitle the university not only to discipline her for that future violation, but also to re-open the original charges against Ms. Washington arising out of May 1 and May 2 and to further sanction her for those past incidents."

	- "193. The Agreement is now part of Ms. Washington’s student record and will be maintained by the Office of Student Conduct for five years from the date of the letter. 194. Ms. Washington now also faces the possibility that her disciplinary file could be reopened at any time. 195. Ms. Washington signed the Agreement of Resolution on July 25, 2024. She did so without admitting to any wrongdoing or violation of the Student Code of Conduct."


- The argument with respect to their arrest in the first place,

	- "227. Defendants unlawfully and without legal justification caused the arrest of Plaintiffs Graeme
	Blair and Catherine Washington on May 2, 2024."

	- "228. Defendants caused and effectuated the arrest of Plaintiffs without a warrant and without
	probable cause."

	- "229. Defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Plaintiffs because there was no underlying
	criminal offense that could justify the unlawful assembly declaration, which was based solely on
	violations of university policy, not on the existence of criminality, violence, or the clear and present
	danger of imminent violence, as required under California law. See In re Brown, 9 Cal. 3d at 624 (“An unlawful act within the meaning of section 407 . . . means criminal conduct prohibited by state
	law.”)."

	- "230. Because the unlawful assembly declaration was itself unlawful, there was no probable cause
	to arrest for failure to disperse under California Penal Code section 409, which applies only when an
	individual has been “lawfully warned to disperse.”"

	- "231. Moreover, when Defendants arrested Plaintiffs, they failed to make any effort to distinguish
	between the participants in any unlawful activity and innocent bystanders, as required to carry out a
	lawful arrest for failure to disperse under Penal Code section 409. See Dubner v. City & Cnty. of San
	Francisco, 266 F.3d 959, 967 (9th Cir. 2001)."

- Events surrounding April 30th

	- Whether the school opts to divest or not, and whatever the reason for why there was divestment in the past versus now are irrelevant to what I care about

	- Looks like the counter-protesters were only there to harass students (see 87.)

		- "88. As the harassers turned violent on the evening of April 28, UCLA administrators did not
		intervene and offered no support to the students inside the otherwise nonviolent encampment. 89. As a result, increasingly larger numbers of individuals harassed, attacked, and attempted to
		dismantle the encampment at UCLA on the evenings of April 29 and April 30."

	- "100. One demonstrator asked a UCLA-hired security guard why they were not assisting the victims of the violence. The guard responded that what those in the encampment were facing was their own fault."

	- "I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,’ they said. ‘I’ve never heard any of my friends scream like that before. … It’s still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.’”"

	- "102. The same report described another student who was hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment’s barricade and their fellow students. This student “said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples. ‘I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,’ the student recalled.”

	- "103. Later reports confirmed that twenty-five pro-Palestine protesters were hospitalized because of injuries inflicted by mob violence."

	- "111. When pushed, he said it was because of “the people that attacked you last night,” saying “[t]he point is to shut down an unsafe situation because we think the people [referring to the mob] are going to come back and we don’t know how many may come back.” 

	- "115. UC and UCLA administrators did not need to shut down the encampment to protect
	individuals inside from future mob activity. They enjoyed ample resources, time, and wherewithal to develop a plan to discourage harassment and violent attacks against the encampment through a
	combination of physical barriers, security, and de-escalation tactics."

- UCLA community response

	- "142. A group of 86 UCLA School of Law faculty and staff members issued a statement “strongly
	condemn[ing] the violent attack on UCLA students by a mob of outsiders unaffiliated with UCLA”
	along with “the university’s failure to take the steps necessary to protect our students’ peaceful
	protest, despite the administration’s being on notice well before April 30 of the imminent risk of
	serious violence against the students in the encampment.” The faculty and staff issued a list of
	requests of the administration, including a complete investigation into its handling of the events,
	assistance to the victims of the mob violence, and to work with faculty “to develop strategies that
	allow protests and counter-protests to occur safely in the future.” "

	- "143. a cohort of 76 UCLA Jewish faculty and staff released a statement calling for,
	among other things, “the university to ensure that all students, faculty, and staff who were arrested
	for being part of or in solidarity with the encampment are provided with full amnesty and are assured
	that they will not be targeted again by UCLA or any UC administrators for engaging in peaceful
	protest.”"

	- "144. Faculty from the Department of Comparative Literature issued a statement stating that “[t]he
	university has not only failed to protect those rights of free expression; it has actively hindered them,
	 our students and colleagues vulnerable to assault and arrest, and breached the trust of the
	campus community.”"

	- "145. A group of 46 UCLA library staff echoed these statements, describing how “[t]he
	University’s inaction for hours while students in the encampment were attacked by a violent mob of
	counter protesters is especially horrifying given the overwhelming police force that was summoned
	the following day” to clear the encampment. They noted that “[r]egardless of your views on the
	encampment, this response [to forcibly clear the encampment] is abhorrent and at odds with principles—such as freedom of expression and student safety—that should be fundamental to any university campus. It sends a message that future protests are vulnerable to campus-approved suppression by either a mob or law enforcement.”"

	- "146. In another statement, members of the UCLA Mathematics Department wrote that they
	“condemn the conduct of our university administration to the student-led demonstrations protesting
	violence against Palestinians in Gaza,” noting that “[i]ndependent of our political views, we find the
	administration’s response shameful in its failure to protect our students and their freedom of
	expression.” The statement describes how “the administration used [the mob] violence against the
	protestors to justify clearing the protestors by force,” and demanded that the administration release
	an explanation for why it took its speech-suppressive actions."

	- "147. A larger petition signed by 906 UCLA faculty members decried the “violent and aggressive
	police sweep” of the encampment and the arrest of “more than 200 students, faculty, and staff
	arrested while peacefully protesting.” The petition asked that then-Chancellor Block resign, that
	UCLA recommend charges against those arrested be dropped, and that UCLA disclose and divest
	from investments in “military weapons production companies and supporting systems, in dialogue
	with the demands of the student protestors."


### Free speech precedent 

- [Legal precedent explained](https://freespeech.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/core-policies/protected-speech-discrimination-and-harassment#:~:text=Otherwise%20known%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9CFighting,Mason%20Univ.%2C%201991)

	- Like Title IX, legal precedent has significantly narrower protections 

		- "In higher education, the harassing behavior (including speech) must be of a kind that is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institutions’ resources and opportunities.” (Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 1999)."

	- UCLA may not be liable legally, but under Title VI it has an obligation to respond

		- "For almost 3 decades, Title IX has effectively been broader than the Davis standard “because the Department also believes a broader standard is appropriate to enforce Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in the administrative context, in which educational access is the goal and private damages are not at issue.”" (from updates to Title IX doc)

	- "We called on the Chancellor to take responsibility for this failure and take steps immediately against the counter protesters. We stated to the Chancellor, who wrote about Jewish students existing in a state of anxiety and fear
	despite the considerable violence directed at anyone speaking out against the genocide, that his
	emphasis on Jewish students feelings about Palestinian solidarity on the campus was serving to
	inflame the situation and embolden attacks on the Palestinian Solidarity Encampment. When we met with Chancellor Block on May 1, ostensibly to discuss with EVCP Hunt the considerable violence against the students, and to inform the chancellor that his remarks about Jewish students’ fear and discomfort serve to authorize counter protesters and to frame the students as violent, UCLA had already decided to clear the encampment. In the ensuing police response, many students were physically hurt by police and over 200 students, staff, and faculty were arrested and charged (see below). We have documented multiple injuries from rubber bullets and police batons"

	- Looks like the authors are university professors, [Gaye Theresa Johnson](https://afam.ucla.edu/person/gaye-theresa-johnson/)

	- The letter goes through the students' intentions wrt the protest on June 10th

	- "Chancellor Block created the office unilaterally, without a search, a vetting process, faculty or 
	staff input—and not even a consideration that Braziel’s appointment might be temporary or 
	interim. "

	- Pp. 6 costs of policing 

	- Pp. 11 laws around aiming projectiles to disperse crowds

	- Based on video footage the description of police brutality is exaggerated 

	- "Then at one point a UCPD officer shot a student in the chest with a rubber bullet from a distance of 
	about five feet away, surely a violation of the rules for the use of such armaments, which can be 
	lethal at such ranges. The force of the bullet knocked them down and two fellow students assisted 
	them to safety through the bushes. The student suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised 
	lung and was taken by car to the ER at Ronald Reagan Hospital. They remained there for two 
	days given the severity of the injury, which caused elevated cardiac enzymes. This situation could 
	have ended with a permanent disability or death and is a stark reminder of why it is so dangerous 
	to simply transfer control of campus to a militarized police force. Other students were injured as 
	well, one suffering from a concussion, others from bruises and lacerations.3"

	- [Gaza war protesters clash with police at new UCLA encampment](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4715568-gaza-war-student-protesters-police-ucla-encampment/)

		- "UCLA Associate professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student had to go to the hospital after they were hit with a rubber bullet. 

			“They were shot in the chest from 10-15 feet range,” Blair told The Hill."

		- "Many eyewitness reports, including the experiences of several Dodd Hall occupants, as well as documentary video and photographic evidence, support the claim that the violence was incited by police and security, rather than the protesting students."

	- [Footage here shows the kettling](https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1800640869869228490?s=46&t=fKh9XATL-WMti11DkcbvEg) on June 10th

	- The above doc said they were given a dispersal order then kettled. The police press release does say they essentially moved the students around the campus. 

	- Braziel mentioned the best way to conceal security forces would be to put them in blue in gold polo shirts and hide them in buildings, this would effectively make campus feel more like campus. Clearly professors find that disruptive.
