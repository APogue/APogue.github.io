Thesis: Safety through accountability

Thesis1: It becomes more clear that a pattern of bias existed during the major protest (which was garnering media attention) when the administration began releasing statements acknowledging problems, but deliberately avoided condemnation or promises to take action against alleged perpetrators of harassment and violence. 

Thesis2: When things got completely out of hand, even after police arrived they did nothing. When all was said and done, Thomas took the brunt of the blame. 


### Administrative messaging 

- [Friday 4/26– Mary Osako](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-about-encampment-on-campus-april-26), Vice Chacellor for Strategic Communications wrote---

	 “It’s also important to note that we are following University of California systemwide policy guidance, which directs us not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community.”

- [Mary Osako Sunday 4/28](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-28)- 

	- 11:22 a.m.---"“This morning, a group of demonstrators breached a barrier that the university had established separating two groups of protestors on our campus, resulting in physical altercations. UCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken about the violence that broke out.”"

	- 4:19 p.m.---“UCLA has a long history of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken to report that today, some physical altercations broke out among demonstrators on Royce Quad.

		“We have since instituted additional security measures and increased the numbers of our safety team members on site."

		“As an institution of higher education, we stand firmly for the idea that even when we disagree, we must still engage respectfully and recognize one another’s humanity. We are dismayed that certain individuals instead chose to jeopardize the physical safety of the community.”

- [Mary Osako Tuesday 4/30 11:48 a.m.](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-30)

	 "“Yesterday some physical altercations occurred among demonstrators in Royce Quad. In response, we have taken several actions to significantly increase our security presence, including adding greater numbers of campus law enforcement, safety personnel and student affairs monitors. 


	“There was also a report of a student’s access to class being blocked by demonstrators yesterday. This kind of disruption to our teaching and learning mission is abhorrent, plain and simple. As such, we’ve taken several, immediate actions: Our student conduct process has been initiated, and could lead to severe disciplinary action including expulsion or suspension. The barriers that demonstrators used to block this student’s access to class have been removed and we have staff located around Royce Quad to help ensure that they will not go up again. We have also engaged law enforcement to investigate.


	“While the demonstration remains largely peaceful, our campus must remain a place where we treat one another with respect and recognize our shared humanity — not a place where we devolve into violence and bullying.” "

- [Gene Block Tuesday 4/30 5:04 p.m.](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/affirming-our-values-in-a-challenging-time)

	"Many of the demonstrators, as well as counter-demonstrators who have come to the area, have been peaceful in their activism. But the tactics of others have frankly been shocking and shameful. We have seen instances of violence completely at odds with our values as an institution dedicated to respect and mutual understanding. In other cases, students on their way to class have been physically blocked from accessing parts of the campus.


	UCLA supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid. These incidents have put many on our campus, especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear.


	In response, we’ve taken several immediate actions. We have significantly increased our security presence in the area, including adding greater numbers of law enforcement officers, safety personnel and student affairs mitigators. We have also engaged law enforcement to investigate the recent acts of violence. 


	The barriers that demonstrators used to block access to buildings have been removed, and we have staff located around Royce Quad to help ensure that they will not go up again. With regard to these incidents, our student conduct process has been initiated, and could lead to disciplinary action including suspension or expulsion."

- [April 30th Message for Those in UCLA Encampment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dmqAjbGiet8_PGS5cG632mjvPVt3geq5/view)

	"The established encampment is unlawful and violates university policy.

	For non-UCLA affiliates: Please be aware that your presence on campus as a non-affiliate engaged in an encampment violates the law and constitutes criminal behavior subject to misdemeanor charges."

	"Law enforcement is on hand to protect and keep safe demonstrators, counter-demonstrators, students, faculty, staff, non-affiliates and everyone in the campus and off-campus community. Law enforcement is prepared to arrest individuals, in accordance with applicable law.

	Non-UCLA persons are notified to leave the encampment and depart the campus immediately."

	"Students, staff and faculty who have joined the encampment should identify themselves, if requested...We are asking students, staff and faculty to leave the area. Those who choose to remain---including both students and employees---could face sanctions...[that] could lead to dismissal."

	- This is a clear case of biased handling, there was no notification given to counter-protesters partaking in the harassment of other protesters, or other unlawful behavior like masking and carrying weapons


### Protest events 

- [Thursday 4/25](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/counter-protesters-demonstrate-against-pro-palestine-encampment)

	“More counter-protesters gathered, with nearly 50 people there shortly before 7 p.m. Some waving megaphones shouted at students, who they called “terrorists,” to “show your face.””


- [Sunday 4/28](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/28/protesters-counter-protesters-clash-as-they-converge-upon-ucla-encampment)

	“Graeme Blair, an associate professor of political science inside the encampment, said in a statement sent over text message that he believes counter-protesters were attempting to start conflicts with members of the encampment.” Blair gave a statement to The Hill about June 10th, and is also involved in a SoCal ACLU lawsuit. 

	- [I’m a UCLA professor. Why didn’t the administration stop last night’s egregious violence?](https://forward.com/opinion/608479/ucla-violence-campus-protests/), David Myers' full credentials need to be listed. He is currently the head of the team tasked with improving campus climate. He would be objective. 

		- "On Sunday..." He goes into specifics on this day and on the following Tuesday riot. 

		- "Not only must we recognize one another’s humanity, we must also learn to engage respectfully. In line with this, UCLA is substantially expanding its Dialogue across Difference (DaD) initiative, which will now move under the banner of UCLA’s Bedari Kindness Institute. Sady and Ludwig Kahn Professor of Jewish History David Myers, who leads the DaD initiative, has been named director of the institute."

- [Monday 4/29](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/ucpd-responds-to-counter-protesters-midnight-attempt-to-breach-encampment)

	“Around 60 counter-protesters attempted to breach the entrance of the encampment in Dickson Plaza around midnight Tuesday morning, drawing the presence of six UCPD officers in riot gear.”

	"A fight between members of both sides broke out around 11:40 p.m., leading the six UCPD officers to separate counter-protesters and participants of the encampment. Protesters inside the encampment brought wooden planks to the Powell scaffolding to block the entrance. CSC security officers then used their bikes to create a barrier between UCPD, counter-protesters and those inside the encampment."

	“UC Divest Coalition at UCLA said in a written press release that it believes violence on campus was caused primarily by counter-protesters supporting Israel, some of whom the protesters allege threatened them with weapons. They added that they believe the administration has failed to protect students on campus.”


- [Block indicates potential consequences for protesters, condemns campus aggression](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/block-indicates-potential-consequences-for-protesters-condemns-campus-aggression)

	- Published on April 30, 2024 5:52 p.m.

	- "The university has not previously called the encampment unlawful or unauthorized."

	- "“We will not leave,” UC Divest said in the press release. “We will remain here until our demands are met.”"


### UCLA does damage control

- Block congressional hearing 

### Post-protest finger pointing 

- Braziel said (Bruin article)

- Mayor Bass said 

### Irvine chancellor

- He reaches out directly to the encampment

- It seemed with UCLA they were communicating through the Daily Bruin, the People's Council or some other 3rd party channel

- That is incredibly unsafe not to try to interact with them directly
