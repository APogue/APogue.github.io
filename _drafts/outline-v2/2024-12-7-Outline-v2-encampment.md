## hook 2

‘You guys are about to get f—ed up’



“In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment.”

## journalist testimonials

"Daily Bruin news editor Catherine Hamilton, 21, told The Times she recognized one of the counterprotesters as someone who had previously verbally harassed her and taken pictures of her press badge. The individual instructed the group to encircle the student journalists, she said, before they sprayed the four with Mace or pepper spray, flashed lights in their faces and chanted Hamilton’s name.

As she tried to break free, Hamilton said, she was punched repeatedly in the chest and upper abdomen; another student journalist was pushed to the ground and beaten and kicked for nearly a minute. The attack was first reported in the Daily Bruin."

This can be connected with the arrest


Student B, who was also in the encampment that night, said they felt Dickson Plaza had turned into a war zone as they watched the number of injured students increase.


“I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,” they said. “I’ve never heard any of my friends scream like that before. … It’s still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.”

Student C said they were hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment’s barricade and their fellow students. They said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples.

“I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,” they said. “The only thing that kept me moving forward was my … classmates who were brave enough to protect the encampment from these terrorists. The same classmates that courageously brought me back inside the encampment after my attack. The same classmates who I relied on to save my life.”









## hook 2

When the administration came to the decision to remove the encampment on May 1st after a week long protest turned violent the evening before, Darnell "Hunt told students that the reason for the decision was to protect student safety in the wake of the mob violence: "These police officers to my understanding were given the mandate to to clear out the encampment because of security risks."

When pushed, he said it was because of "the people that attacked you last night," saying "[t]he point is to shut down an unsafe situation because we think the people [referring to the mob] are going to come back and we don't know how many may come back"

Mr. Hunt conceded that the university initially supported student' rights to be at and maintain the encampment until the mob violence broke out, saying, "when this encampment set up, we did not move to dismantle it. In fact, we were working with you to keep it going until what happened last night." [source](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/blair_v_regents_complaint.pdf)





## Thomas

Why the university prepared for the mob that attacked the encampment on the evening of April 30th? 

In the prevailing narrative, Chief of UCPD John Thomas failed in his role to keep the campus community safe. 

“Days earlier, campus leadership had directed Thomas to create a safety plan that would protect the UCLA community after the encampment was put up last week and began drawing agitators, the sources said. The chief was told to spare no expense to bring in other UC police officers, offer overtime and hire as many private security officers needed to keep the peace.”

“But university leadership, he said, decided to allow the tents “as an expression of students’ 1st Amendment rights” and directed that police not be included in any security plan. Under UC’s systemwide community safety plan, police are deployed as a last resort — guidance developed after UC Davis police pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters in 2011, setting off a firestorm of controversy and an internal review that changed campus practices.”

## Hate speech constitutes harassment 

- no deterrence to hate speech and physicality constituting harassment and a hostile environment

- blockades went up because people were harassing 

## Why did take so long for block to get LAPD onto campus




### Wasteful wasteful spending on speech absent of deterrence rhetoric, ie the cost of these protests, the costs of policing peaceful students 

- Rick Braziel 

	- what is his actual role

	- tons of spending going in to complete tasks he was brought on for through independent contractors 

	- feels like installing him so quickly without due diligence process was damage control 

	- really just pointing the guns at students with answers of more, more, more security and police personnel for any event (polo shirts, hide people in buildings)

- tons of money is being spent on policing activity on campus rather than using deterrence rhetoric

- tons of money is being spent on policing peaceful students

- all the money spent on munitions is being used on students only, why? 




## policy

what weapons were used, what is the list of banned items in ucla policy

Bear spray?

Bear spray is formulated to have a longer range (Counter Assault Bear Spray can reach up to 40 feet) than pepper spray (designed to only reach about 10 feet).

While responses to requests for passage varied, the question "are you a Zionist" was captured on film on several occasions.

"RG Cravens, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, has tracked the Leave Our Kids Alone protests since they began disrupting school board meetings last summer and threw their weight behind a controversial anti-trans statewide ballot measure.

The reason these counter-demonstrators are drawn to protests over the war in the Middle East, he said, was that they see them through the prism of a broader rightwing view that “traditional” societies and families are under threat. “Their animosity towards the campus demonstrations are part of this Christian far-right perspective that LGBTQ folks are threats to Christianity, and so are Palestinians or Muslims,” Cravens said."




## Title VI

Swastikas and the contemporary workaround 





## Hook 1 

"Interrupted an interview of a guy calling the encampment antisemitic to say free Palestine, and the guy (interviewee) or one of the cameramen or one of the interviewee’s friends turned around and called me a faggot straight up. So much for those LGBTQ+ rights in Israel amirite

Also the reporter laughed no kidding the camera men too this was KTLA btw...just trash as fuck like u live in socal bro.” ￼


## Hillel

Who are Hillel, nationally? 

statement about the screen

Is anyone listening to them? 

In response to the pig effigy the older guy from Hillel worked with admin on some initiative

But is anyone listening to the students? 

Can't say out loud but---

Is this all part of a greater scheme to turn students against each other

In doing so, they are emulating the current zeitgeist, contemporary society's worst traits 

## Outline

Hatespeech to far-right groups to Tsives and Milagro to USAC to shit talking on Verdugo

JVP and SJP setup the (without CAC, why?) encampment to physical barriers were the solution 

to encampment violence
