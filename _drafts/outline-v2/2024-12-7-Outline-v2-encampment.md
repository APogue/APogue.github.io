## Notes

Start with Hillel 

Established that discrimination is okay 

- by 1st amendment protections, it has to be harassment essentially to trigger the law

Discrimination seems to be handled inconsistently, on a case by case basis 

- student conduct initiation, condemning it, or they're removing it without acknowledgment 

“Our review of emails and other electronic communications revealed that, once the encampment was established, administrators were bombarded with questions from within and outside the UCLA community about how it planned to respond. **Particularly after social media posts about Jewish students being excluded from portions of campus went viral**, administrators were inundated with complaints and concerns from parents, politicians, and community members about why the University was allowing it to continue.”

I’ve emailed you previously with respect to UCLA and rampant antisemitism on
campus. **I am
forwarding a viral video demanding the Regents investigate and suspend and expel
these students**.
There is no privacy rights to encampments on public property. UCLA is a public
university funded by the
taxpayer. The video highlights the Regents ongoing failure to protect the safety
and security of Jewish
students.
I expect a reply and a letter to all students and members of the UCLA community
discussing this
incident, denouncing it, and reiterating UCLA commitment to the safety of its
student body.


## Continue thought flow from 'intro'

Following a large-scale pro-Palestine protest that escalated into rioting last spring, the administration took immediate measures to address security gaps it reasoned were the cause.

These moves were made while the "marketplace" was flooded with opinions of what went wrong.

To ameliorate any confusion and restore faith in accountability  , UCOP Drake hired an independent consulting agency to review all procedures immediately leading up to and following the major protest and subsequent encampment removal by police. 

"UC President Michael V. Drake, in a letter to the University of California Board of Regents obtained by The Times, said the way the incident was handled requires an outside inquiry.
 
“There is sufficient confusion that I am ordering an independent external review of UCLA’s planning and its actions and of the mutual aid response” by law enforcement, he wrote in the letter. “I believe such a review can address many of my immediate questions but also help guide us for possible future events.”"

## Eli Tsives

The report made use of empirical evidence in an attempt to identify the root cause of certain actions taken by the administration. 

Seemingly aware of the flawed logic, the report was sufficiently vague, effectively putting into words what "could have been the cause of this" or "what might have been the reasoning" for that. 

It also refrained from placing blame on individual actors, broadly referring to agencies or groups of administrators, and made use of euphemisms to avoid language that might be construed as "problematic" for UCLA's reputation. 

The above looks like plausible deniability 

"Our review of emails and other electronic communications revealed that, once the encampment was established, administrators were bombarded with questions from within and outside the UCLA community about how it planned to respond. **Particularly after social media posts about Jewish students being excluded from portions of campus went viral**, administrators were inundated with complaints and concerns from parents, politicians, and community members about why the University was allowing it to continue."

"Administrators, including communications professionals, scrambled to respond. As with other aspects of the University’s response, it was often unclear who the final decision-makers were, leading to conflict between administrators and communications professionals. Simultaneously, the absence of clear response objectives and plans resulted in **a muddled communication strategy that, at times, prioritized optics over other interests**."

## journalist testimonials

"Daily Bruin news editor Catherine Hamilton, 21, told The Times she recognized one of the counterprotesters as someone who had previously verbally harassed her and taken pictures of her press badge. The individual instructed the group to encircle the student journalists, she said, before they sprayed the four with Mace or pepper spray, flashed lights in their faces and chanted Hamilton’s name.

As she tried to break free, Hamilton said, she was punched repeatedly in the chest and upper abdomen; another student journalist was pushed to the ground and beaten and kicked for nearly a minute. The attack was first reported in the Daily Bruin."

This can be connected with the arrest


Student B, who was also in the encampment that night, said they felt Dickson Plaza had turned into a war zone as they watched the number of injured students increase.


“I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,” they said. “I’ve never heard any of my friends scream like that before. … It’s still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.”

https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/07/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-ucla-encampment-protesters-recall-april-30-attack

Student C said they were hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment’s barricade and their fellow students. They said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples.

“I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,” they said. “The only thing that kept me moving forward was my … classmates who were brave enough to protect the encampment from these terrorists. The same classmates that courageously brought me back inside the encampment after my attack. The same classmates who I relied on to save my life.”

## Thomas

Why the university prepared for the mob that attacked the encampment on the evening of April 30th? 

In the prevailing narrative, Chief of UCPD John Thomas failed in his role to keep the campus community safe. 

“Days earlier, campus leadership had directed Thomas to create a safety plan that would protect the UCLA community after the encampment was put up last week and began drawing agitators, the sources said. The chief was told to spare no expense to bring in other UC police officers, offer overtime and hire as many private security officers needed to keep the peace.”

“But university leadership, he said, decided to allow the tents “as an expression of students’ 1st Amendment rights” and directed that police not be included in any security plan. Under UC’s systemwide community safety plan, police are deployed as a last resort — guidance developed after UC Davis police pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters in 2011, setting off a firestorm of controversy and an internal review that changed campus practices.”

## Hate speech constitutes harassment 

- the issue with the mitigators is they are not addressing a systemic issue 

- no deterrence to hate speech and physicality constituting harassment and a hostile environment

- blockades went up because people were harassing 

## Why did take so long for block to get LAPD onto campus

## Hook 1 

"Interrupted an interview of a guy calling the encampment antisemitic to say free Palestine, and the guy (interviewee) or one of the cameramen or one of the interviewee’s friends turned around and called me a faggot straight up. So much for those LGBTQ+ rights in Israel amirite

Also the reporter laughed no kidding the camera men too this was KTLA btw...just trash as fuck like u live in socal bro.”

## Hillel

Who are Hillel, nationally? 

statement about the screen

Is anyone listening to them? 

In response to the pig effigy the older guy from Hillel worked with admin on some initiative

But is anyone listening to the students? 

Can't say out loud but---

Is this all part of a greater scheme to turn students against each other

In doing so, they are emulating the current zeitgeist, contemporary society's worst traits 

## The Davis Standard ------------------------------------------------------------------

 "This Wasn't a Failure of Resources, It Was a Failure of Judgment."

The Davis Standard & UCLA’s Duty to Provide a Safe Learning Environment
The Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (1999) standard establishes that public institutions, including universities, can be held liable for deliberate indifference to harassment, violence, or threats that deprive students of access to education. While the case was about Title IX and peer-on-peer harassment, the core principle—an institution’s duty to protect students from known harm—applies broadly, including under Title VI.

1. The Core Duty: Ensuring a Safe Learning Environment
Public universities like UCLA do not just have a general obligation to promote safety—they have a legally recognized duty to prevent students from being subjected to an environment so hostile that it interferes with their education.

This duty does not require the university to prevent all violence—but it does require them to take reasonable steps to stop foreseeable and escalating harm.
If a school knows about a dangerous situation and fails to take meaningful action, they are complicit in the harm that follows.
📌 Davis sets the threshold for liability at:
✔ Severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment or violence
✔ Actual knowledge by the institution
✔ Deliberate indifference (they had the power to act but failed to do so)
✔ Denial of access to educational opportunities

2. How This Applies to UCLA
UCLA had clear, documented knowledge that tensions between protest groups were escalating into violence. They acknowledged it, yet took no preventative action.

Severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harm → ✔

The violence didn’t happen in a vacuum—it built over time.
The university admitted that fights were breaking out, SWAT was called, and threats were being made.
Actual knowledge → ✔

Public statements, internal emails, and student complaints show that UCLA’s administration knew about the rising violence well before the major attack.
Deliberate indifference → ✔

They could have acted, but they didn’t.
UCLA had options: increased security, dispersal orders, mediation, controlled protest zones—but they waited until violence exploded before stepping in.
This wasn't a lack of awareness—it was a conscious decision to delay intervention.
Denial of access to education → ✔

Students—on both sides—were physically attacked and unable to safely participate in campus life.
The climate was so hostile that UCLA had to completely shut down the protests, showing they failed to maintain control.

3. Why This is So Damning for UCLA
UCLA cannot claim this was unforeseeable when they had weeks of warning signs.
By allowing violence to escalate to a breaking point before intervening, they let outside forces dictate campus policy.
Their failure to act did not just affect free speech—it endangered students' physical safety.

4. Making This a Public Narrative
✔ Frame this as a Student Safety Failure, Not Just a Speech Issue

While legal arguments focus on Title VI, the bigger scandal is that UCLA administrators knowingly let students get hurt.
If they had enforced campus policies earlier, no students—pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, or neutral—would have been put at risk.
✔ Use UCLA’s Own Statements & Internal Reports Against Them

Compare their “calls for civil discourse” to their actual failure to intervene.
Highlight when they acted (only after chaos) vs. when they should have acted.
✔ Show the Pattern: Deliberate Indifference is a Recurring Institutional Failure

If UCLA failed here, what else are they failing to address?
Is this a broader issue of administrative neglect when it comes to campus safety?



| **Legal Standard**                              | **Title IX (Davis Standard - Education)**                                        | **Title VI (Race/National Origin Discrimination)**                        |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Can the school be liable for failing to stop harassment or violence?** | Yes, if they were deliberately indifferent to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment that deprived a student of educational access. | Yes, but usually only if there is evidence of intentional discrimination (e.g., policies, actions, or failures to act that show a pattern of bias). |
| **Does the school have to take direct action to discriminate?** | No. Liability exists if they know about harassment and fail to take reasonable steps. | Usually, yes. Liability often requires proof that the institution acted (or failed to act) with discriminatory intent. |
| **Does administrative neglect count?** | Yes—deliberate indifference applies. | Only if it suggests an intent to discriminate. |

















4. How This Affects a Public Argument
If this were a lawsuit, proving a Title VI violation would be difficult unless you had strong evidence of intentional discrimination. But in terms of public accountability, UCLA’s failure to protect students from foreseeable violence can still be framed as a major failure of duty.

Instead of focusing on the legal standard of "intent," a public report could highlight:
✔ Pattern of neglect that disproportionately harmed certain student groups.
✔ Inconsistent policy enforcement that suggests UCLA favored one side over the other.
✔ Emails and statements showing that UCLA had actual knowledge of escalating violence but still did nothing.

📌 Key takeaway: While Davis applies more directly to Title IX, a strong public argument can be made that UCLA failed to uphold the spirit of both Title VI and Title IX by knowingly allowing students to be put in danger.

Would you want to cross-analyze UCLA’s responses to different incidents to show clear bias or disparate treatment? That could help make the strongest case for deliberate inaction.



1. Why Kettling is a Student Safety Issue (Not Just a Free Speech Issue)
🔴 Kettling is a controversial police tactic where officers trap a group of protesters in a confined space, restricting their ability to leave.
🔴 This has been criticized because it creates severe safety risks, including:

Trampling and crowd crush risks
Heat exhaustion/dehydration (if held for long periods without water)
Medical emergencies being ignored (as people are physically prevented from leaving)
Exposure to tear gas or baton strikes with no escape route
📌 If UCLA allowed police to kettle students, the strongest argument is that this was a failure of duty of care—especially if it led to injuries, panic, or medical crises.

2. UCLA’s Contradictory Handling of Protest Safety
By focusing on danger, you can expose UCLA’s inconsistency in handling protests:

They allowed unchecked violence between protest groups for days (leading to actual physical harm).
Then, for a later protest, they responded with a highly aggressive, unsafe crowd-control tactic that put students at risk.
👉 This creates a damning contradiction:

When students were actually at risk of being attacked by counterprotesters, UCLA delayed action.
But when students were peacefully protesting, they used excessive force that created a new safety hazard.
This suggests UCLA wasn’t enforcing policies based on safety concerns, but rather in an arbitrary or politically motivated way.

3. Why This is a Stronger Argument Than a Free Speech Claim
If you argue this is about student rights, UCLA can justify it by saying, “We were just enforcing protest rules.”
If you argue this is about safety, UCLA has no easy defense. They have to explain:
Why they allowed actual violence to escalate in the first protest but
Chose to use dangerous tactics against students who weren’t engaging in violence later.
This forces UCLA into an indefensible position—either they were negligent in preventing violence earlier, or they acted recklessly in kettling students later.

4. Key Evidence to Strengthen the Argument
✅ Video footage showing how the kettling put students at risk (panic, medical needs being ignored, police escalation, etc.).
✅ Statements from students who experienced it (Were they scared? Did they feel physically endangered?).
✅ Comparing UCLA’s statements about protest response—did they say they were prioritizing safety, yet allowed unsafe conditions in both cases?
✅ Any internal security documents explaining why kettling was used—did UCLA officials approve of it or push for it?

Would you want to cross-reference who made the decisions in these two protests to see if the same officials were involved in both the negligence and the later overreach? That could help expose institutional inconsistency.




📌 Fear alone does not make something unlawful.

If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite "Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid" instead of just saying, "this was an unlawful obstruction"?
This suggests UCLA was justifying their actions based on public perception, rather than clear, consistent enforcement of university policy.





2. The Contradiction in UCLA’s Approach
If UCLA says “We shut down the encampment because the acts making students feel unsafe were unlawful (blocking walkways)”, then ask:

🔍 Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways) to continue for days before acting?
🔍 Why did UCLA ignore student safety concerns about antisemitism when no laws were broken, but suddenly take those concerns seriously when laws were technically violated?
🔍 Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?

📌 Key Argument: If UCLA was truly concerned with student safety, it would have addressed threats consistently, not selectively waited until it had a legal justification to shut the protest down.


✔ Shift away from "why UCLA acted" to "how UCLA acted."
1. The Stronger, Provable Argument
Instead of speculating about intent, the argument should be:

🔴 UCLA selectively enforced safety concerns.

They ignored antisemitism and Jewish student complaints for months.
Then they cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.
🔴 UCLA’s responses were inconsistent and reactive.

They let blockades continue for days before acting.
They failed to act on violence between groups until it escalated.
They were slow to act when pro-Palestinian students were at risk, but fast to act when shutting them down.
📌 Key Argument (That Doesn’t Require Speculation): UCLA’s approach to campus safety was arbitrary and inconsistent. That’s a provable failure, regardless of political stance.

3. The Big Takeaway: UCLA’s Institutional Failure Goes Beyond One Protest
UCLA allowed exclusion to become normalized in student government and campus life.
UCLA failed to address it when it was directed at Jewish students for months.
When that same exclusionary logic escalated into the protest blockade, UCLA suddenly acted—too little, too late.
They weren’t just negligent in the moment—they were complicit in fostering an environment where exclusion was allowed to thrive.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deliberate Indifference is a Recurring Institutional Failure


This Wasn’t a Failure of Resources, It Was a Failure of Judgment


They were complicit in fostering an environment where exclusion was allowed to thrive


Truth can be to divide as much as for anything else. If the university saw CAC's messaging as the truth about Palestinian sentiment against Jews, then they might be politically motivated to allow it to continue 


CAC's rhetoric, while protected, garnered a lot of attention and should have been a warning about potentially exclusive practices that may likely occur. 


instance of free speech protections 


instance free speech protections 


when exclusion began, ignored 



By totality of circumstances it was becoming that the environment was becoming hostile 


again free speech allows for certain events to occur 


but they need to be on the ready for the moment exclusion begins 


and they weren't 


they allowed exclusion to go on for days when it came to the encampment 



if the encampment is in essence a jew exclusion zone, or an Israeli exclusion zone, and there's symbology within the encampment promoting antisemitic hate, then that's a real problem 

If there are certain things that are exclusionary, then they need to be addressed 




---------------------

- Rift all along between pro-p and Jewish students, school didn't do anything about that

	- the school was also aware that the greater community tracks and targets pro-p students, and even admits their knowledge by social media posts addressing the community 

- Not a surprise to anyone when they begin blockading students from accessing areas of campus, school doesn't do anything about that

	- this was a problem for working students, disabled students, jewish students, people completely uninvolved in this situation politically were dragged into conflict and denied access to areas of campus 

- Then aggravators become increasingly more aggravated, school doesn't do anything about that

	- the school should very much be aware the greater community knows the blockading is happening 

	- the school should be very much aware that counterprotester present a serious security threat, if not from the November or other calls by students for the administration's attention, then by the fights that broke out in the days before

	- yet still the school chooses inflammatory rhetoric, and to never point out who the culprits are who are causing the security threat 

- Pro-p attempts to further protect the encampment from aggravators, only increases the issue for students and increases tensions with aggravators, school doesn't do anything about that

	- in fact it assists in some cases with reinforcing barricades 

- Then when it comes time to shut the encampment down, administration is vague and cryptic, and very late, and does nothing to explain that the law is being broken and that security is now a major issue

	- really they only add fuel to the flames with more inflammatory language 

- The violent riots occur nonetheless, with police response questionable 

- This leads to a forceful takedown of the encampment and classes having to go remote, which was a major problem for parents and students alike

	- So they didn't catch the perps. They should have taken measures to mitigate risk moving forward, i.e. opened an investigation using video footage, reassed SAM's effectiveness in these scenarios, and put out an explicit message to the students and greater LA community that this behavior is not welcome.
