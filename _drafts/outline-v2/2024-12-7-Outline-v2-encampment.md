Blame the administration all the way through... 

## Continue thought flow from 'intro'

Following a large-scale pro-Palestine protest that escalated into rioting last spring, the administration took immediate measures to address security gaps it reasoned were the cause.

These moves were made while the "marketplace" was flooded with opinions of what went wrong.

To ameliorate any confusion and restore faith in accountability, UCOP Drake hired an independent consulting agency to review all procedures immediately leading up to and following the major protest and subsequent encampment removal by police. 

"UC President Michael V. Drake, in a letter to the University of California Board of Regents obtained by The Times, said the way the incident was handled requires an outside inquiry.
 
“There is sufficient confusion that I am ordering an independent external review of UCLA’s planning and its actions and of the mutual aid response” by law enforcement, he wrote in the letter. “I believe such a review can address many of my immediate questions but also help guide us for possible future events.”"

The report made use of empirical evidence in an attempt to identify the root cause of certain actions taken by the administration. 

Seemingly aware of the flawed logic, the report was sufficiently vague, effectively putting into words what "could have been the cause of this" or "what might have been the reasoning" for that. 

It also refrained from placing blame on individual actors, broadly referring to agencies or groups of administrators, and made use of euphemisms to avoid language that might be construed as "problematic" for UCLA's reputation. 

"Our review of emails and other electronic communications revealed that, once the encampment was established, administrators were bombarded with questions from within and outside the UCLA community about how it planned to respond. **Particularly after social media posts about Jewish students being excluded from portions of campus went viral**, administrators were inundated with complaints and concerns from parents, politicians, and community members about why the University was allowing it to continue."

"Administrators, including communications professionals, scrambled to respond. As with other aspects of the University’s response, it was often unclear who the final decision-makers were, leading to conflict between administrators and communications professionals. Simultaneously, the absence of clear response objectives and plans resulted in **a muddled communication strategy that, at times, prioritized optics over other interests**."

‘You guys are about to get f—ed up’



“In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment.”

A lot of confusion around the blockading, the students thought it was no big deal, the protesters thought it was political, and the general public thought it was antisemitic

Not sure the below are credible at all, but the author is a former mayor

## journalist testimonials

"Daily Bruin news editor Catherine Hamilton, 21, told The Times she recognized one of the counterprotesters as someone who had previously verbally harassed her and taken pictures of her press badge. The individual instructed the group to encircle the student journalists, she said, before they sprayed the four with Mace or pepper spray, flashed lights in their faces and chanted Hamilton’s name.

As she tried to break free, Hamilton said, she was punched repeatedly in the chest and upper abdomen; another student journalist was pushed to the ground and beaten and kicked for nearly a minute. The attack was first reported in the Daily Bruin."

This can be connected with the arrest


Student B, who was also in the encampment that night, said they felt Dickson Plaza had turned into a war zone as they watched the number of injured students increase.


“I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,” they said. “I’ve never heard any of my friends scream like that before. … It’s still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.”

Student C said they were hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment’s barricade and their fellow students. They said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples.

“I thought I was going to die. I thought I’d never see my family again,” they said. “The only thing that kept me moving forward was my … classmates who were brave enough to protect the encampment from these terrorists. The same classmates that courageously brought me back inside the encampment after my attack. The same classmates who I relied on to save my life.”












## Thomas

Why the university prepared for the mob that attacked the encampment on the evening of April 30th? 

In the prevailing narrative, Chief of UCPD John Thomas failed in his role to keep the campus community safe. 

“Days earlier, campus leadership had directed Thomas to create a safety plan that would protect the UCLA community after the encampment was put up last week and began drawing agitators, the sources said. The chief was told to spare no expense to bring in other UC police officers, offer overtime and hire as many private security officers needed to keep the peace.”

“But university leadership, he said, decided to allow the tents “as an expression of students’ 1st Amendment rights” and directed that police not be included in any security plan. Under UC’s systemwide community safety plan, police are deployed as a last resort — guidance developed after UC Davis police pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters in 2011, setting off a firestorm of controversy and an internal review that changed campus practices.”

## Hate speech constitutes harassment 

- the issue with the mitigators is they are not addressing a systemic issue 

- no deterrence to hate speech and physicality constituting harassment and a hostile environment

- blockades went up because people were harassing 

## Why did take so long for block to get LAPD onto campus













While responses to requests for passage varied, the question "are you a Zionist" was captured on film on several occasions.

"RG Cravens, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, has tracked the Leave Our Kids Alone protests since they began disrupting school board meetings last summer and threw their weight behind a controversial anti-trans statewide ballot measure.

The reason these counter-demonstrators are drawn to protests over the war in the Middle East, he said, was that they see them through the prism of a broader rightwing view that “traditional” societies and families are under threat. “Their animosity towards the campus demonstrations are part of this Christian far-right perspective that LGBTQ folks are threats to Christianity, and so are Palestinians or Muslims,” Cravens said."

## Hook 1 

"Interrupted an interview of a guy calling the encampment antisemitic to say free Palestine, and the guy (interviewee) or one of the cameramen or one of the interviewee’s friends turned around and called me a faggot straight up. So much for those LGBTQ+ rights in Israel amirite

Also the reporter laughed no kidding the camera men too this was KTLA btw...just trash as fuck like u live in socal bro.” ￼


## Hillel

Who are Hillel, nationally? 

statement about the screen

Is anyone listening to them? 

In response to the pig effigy the older guy from Hillel worked with admin on some initiative

But is anyone listening to the students? 

Can't say out loud but---

Is this all part of a greater scheme to turn students against each other

In doing so, they are emulating the current zeitgeist, contemporary society's worst traits
