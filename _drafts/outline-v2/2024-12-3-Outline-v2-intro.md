When neutrality protects no one, whose voices are truly being heard?

This was the campus environment seen through the eyes of some students in the days following Oct 7th. Groups of students reacted to the events and to each other, and clashed with other non-affiliated parties traveling to campus.

## Hook 1

Days after Oct 7th massacre, ...

Oct 9th 

"In a council meeting two days after the horrific October 7th terrorist attack, Jewish students shared how they had been affected, including students sharing that their loved ones were murdered."

"there is so much propaganda that those are quote-unquote Israelis, those are settlers."

## Pro-Palestinian groups

### CAC

On the same day as the council meeting, the Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA posted on their official Instagram profile. The first line of the post read, "The Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA stands in solidarity with Palestinians in their struggle for liberation from Israel." It also stated, "We also stand on the grounds that decolonization is not a metaphor. **Thus, we honor the Palestinians on the frontlines taking their land and sovereignty back!**"

### SJP

On that same day, Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA posted on Instagram, "Emergency Teach-In On The Crisis in Palestine." "UCLA Professors Makdisi and Razack will be convening a teach-in Wednesday, October 11th both online and in person. **If you are a student seeking more clarity, information, and perspectives on recent escalations in Palestine, we highly encourage you to attend.**"

## Hook 2

Oct 11

 "I'm going to rip your fucking head off

You motherfucker

You better fucking run from me terrorist"


(Student Affairs)


## Chancellor Block

Chancellor Block responded to the Oct 7th attack a few days later.

Oct 13th 

“Only six days ago, a heinous assault was perpetrated upon Israeli civilians by the terror organization 
Hamas, a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly as well as the taking of innocent hostages. Earlier this week, I joined UC leadership in condemning this attack, and as new details have emerged, I can only denounce it further: This was a grievous act of malice and hate. It was, I am pained to say, the largest one-day killing of Jews since the end of the Holocaust.

Since then, Israel has responded to the assault, **leading to a significant loss of Palestinian lives 
and the troubling displacement of large numbers of innocent individuals.**”

“This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many 
intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand 
firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. 
I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, 
but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. **We must not devolve into violating 
one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment 
should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or 
threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911.**”

### r/UCLA

Oct 13th

Within hours discussions began in response. 

"**How can we believe that the UC cares about both Palestinian lives and Israeli lives**, if the 
chancellor puts out this statement. "Grievous" "malice" "despicable" vs. "troubling". Are you joking?"

"They do care about all lives. However not denouncing Hamas when it's a well known terrorist group 
and a religious extremist group would be disgusting."

"You're directing attention away from the point. They denounced Hamas. I never said they shouldn't 
do so. However, they DID NOT denounce the ethnic cleansing that's been ensuing since. That's the point. 
I'm convinced you're choosing to be dense rn."

### Response SJP

Oct 16

"In Chancellor Gene Block's recent statement via mass email, the UC perpetuates Zionist rhetoric by 
justifying the brutal occupation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, naming the Zionist 
regime's genocidal attacks on Gaza as simply a response to "terrorist" attacks. **However, we know 
that Al-Aqsa Flood is not unprovoked.** It is a response to over 75 years of brutal Zionist 
colonization, occupation, ethnic cleansing, the denial of Palestinian refugees' right to return 
to their ancestral homeland, relentless attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque, and indiscriminate bombardment."


## UCLA policy

### UCLA philosophy and policy 

The incidents that occurred and reactions from students can be better understood within the
context of UCLA's mission.

"UCLA’s primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and 
application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society.

To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access 
to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from 
intolerance."

Academic freedom relies on the unfettered, free exchange of ideas in the search for truth. 

While "everyday" exchanges may be qualified for the sake of orthodoxy or 
propriety, this is a societal construct. Truth is absolute. This means it may be shocking or come 
with hate, and in our search to find it, it may not be present at all.

Naturally then, academic freedom and free speech go hand in hand, they protect and 
facilitate one another.

“The freedom to communicate (speech) and the (academic) freedom to inquire are both essential to 
the university’s fundamental mission, “which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it 
to its students and to society at large.””

Discovering knowledge puts the university on the cutting edge of new ideas. The edge is not a place where 
everyone may be "comfortable" and so it relies on the First Amendment to function. 

“Does the First Amendment apply to UCLA? Yes, because as an extension of the California government, 
UCLA is a state actor. So, if UCLA constrains your freedom of speech, then the First Amendment most 
definitely applies.”

### SJP 

Their viewpoint is useful in understanding academic freedom. To understand why a political 
position that sides with a known terrorist organization is protected by the First Amendment
we use UCLA's "two way street" principle. 
  
While land and sovereignty are underlying issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the specific operation’s narrative emphasized religious and humanitarian grievances rather than purely territorial disputes.

Academic freedom reserves the right to study these 
ideas, free from oppression or persecution, free from what the government tells us. 

Therefore, if through the American lens Hamas are terrorists, but through a Palestinian lens Americans, 
or Israelis for that matter, have been terrorists, then the word terrorist for moral purposes has lost 
all meaning. 

From an academic lens, there is no what they "are," based on a societal qualification. We understand any 
entity by the first principles of their actions based only in factual evidence. It is how we seek truth.  

### The Reddit exchange

We don't know who the two anonymous users are in this exchange. They may both be American, or not. OP was sensitive to the Chancellors word choice because it is unclear if on any level he or she is "factoring in" Israel's close alliance with the United States. 

Americans, including myself, who have factored Israel in, might looks at the statement and not even notice the disparate language. Even acknowledging the loss of Palestinian lives less than a week after Oct 7th shows more balance than one might ever see from the mainstream media or certain government officials. 

This "factoring in" is also a societal construct. At universities, when we clash and these constructs break away, the truth lies somewhere within. 

### CAC 

In the Oct 9th statement, CAC also states, "Palestinians should be recognized for their care for the oppressed, and not levied with accusations that conflate the political ideology of zionism with Judaism." It is unclear here how they are defining zionism. But, based on the statement "Israel is a colonial power that oppresses Palestinians...We oppose this oppressive settler power," it is assumed that Israel is considered a Zionist entity and its statehood is illegitimate in the eyes of CAC. This is a political opinion, and it is protected by the First Amendment. 

In the exchange at the council meeting, however, **the CAC Commissioner participated in discrimination based on national origin**.

Her statement collapsed nationality into ideology, and assumed anyone who is Israeli is inherently supportive of Zionist policies, regardless of their personal beliefs or political positions. It ignored any possibility for diversity of thought within Israel, where a wide spectrum of perspectives on issues like the occupation, settlements, and peace with Palestinians may exist.  

Her words **implied that Israelis "deserve to die"** by virtue of being Israeli alone. 

The discrimination becomes clearer when applying UCLA’s two-way street principle. Following the commissioner's logic, Americans—including those strongly opposed to settler-colonialism—would also be deserving of harm solely due to their nationality and its historical context.

If the commissioner discriminated, how might UCLA view her conduct? Isn't she allowed to exercise her right to free speech? Yes she is. 

Student speech is protected under the First Amendment, even if it is offensive or controversial.

**“But as a descriptive statement of law, the assertion “hate speech is not free speech” is just plain wrong.** The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws—including university “speech codes”— that penalize or otherwise regulate “hate speech.””

There are exceptions,

“Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment…**means freedom of speech can sometimes be constrained to further the right to equality.** The reality—and challenge—is that sometimes equality gives way to freedom of speech, and vice versa.”

For practical purposes the exceptions are defined as,

Discrimination---"the **exclusion of a person**, on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion,…**from participation in any academic**, research or other University service, program or activity.”

Or,

Harassment---"conduct that is **sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit an individual’s ability to participate** in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities offered by the University, or creates a work environment that is intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

Sanctions may be enhanced where an individual was selected for harassment because of the individual’s race, color, national or ethnic origin," etc.

We see in both cases, discrimination or harassment must be so severe so as to deprive victims of access to education. 

Mild or isolated offensive speech, even if discriminatory, is unlikely to override First Amendment protections.

"Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, **the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as “unprotected speech” and “less protected speech” narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future.**” 


### The non-affiliates

What about students who were confronted by non-affiliated visitors at the teach-in?

While speech is protected under the First Amendment, even if offensive or controversial, it cannot cross the line into true harassment or violence.

“Remember that **certain forms of speech, such as true threats...**, are unprotected under the First Amendment. There’s a reason why these forms of speech are unprotected (or less protected); as a general rule, it’s understood that they cause concrete harm and provide little if any social value. **UCLA is largely free to regulate those forms of speech** and it should attempt to do so.”

Discriminatory actions or speech that escalate to threats, intimidation, or physical violence are extremely serious. This incident was no exception. 


## Hook 3

 Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

[Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"


## Chancellor Block

The Nov 8th incident warranted [condemnation by Block and Drake](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) on Nov 10th, although the previous incident was not explicitly condemned. 

Nov 10th

"Today, I joined University of California President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors in issuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses — including UCLA — over the past several weeks. We must be crystal clear: discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding."

"At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. **While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment**, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. **Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable.**"

### Response by a student in the Daily Bruin dated Nov 19

"“The Palestinian student said they were disappointed that an Oct. 13 statement by the chancellor described the Oct. 7 attack as a “grievous act of malice and hate” against Israelis but Palestinian deaths as “loss of life,” as the tonal shift emphasizes the violence against Israelis over Palestinians. 

They added that they feel **the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus** because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than Palestinian students.”"
