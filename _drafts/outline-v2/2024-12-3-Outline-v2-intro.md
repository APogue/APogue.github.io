When neutrality protects no one, whose voices are truly being heard?

This was the campus environment seen through the eyes of some students in the days following Oct 7th. Groups of students reacted to the events and to each other, and clashed with other non-affiliated parties traveling to campus.

## Hook 1

Days after Oct 7th massacre, ...

Oct 9th 

"In a council meeting two days after the horrific October 7th terrorist attack, Jewish students shared how they had been affected, including students sharing that their loved ones were murdered."

"there is so much propaganda that those are quote-unquote Israelis, those are settlers."

## Pro-Palestinian groups

### CAC

On the same day as the council meeting, the Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA posted on their official Instagram profile. The first line of the post read, "The Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA stands in solidarity with Palestinians in their struggle for liberation from Israel." It also stated, "We also stand on the grounds that decolonization is not a metaphor. **Thus, we honor the Palestinians on the frontlines taking their land and sovereignty back!**"

### SJP

On that same day, Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA posted on Instagram, "Emergency Teach-In On The Crisis in Palestine." "UCLA Professors Makdisi and Razack will be convening a teach-in Wednesday, October 11th both online and in person. **If you are a student seeking more clarity, information, and perspectives on recent escalations in Palestine, we highly encourage you to attend.**"

## Hook 2

Oct 11

 "I'm going to rip your fucking head off

You motherfucker

You better fucking run from me terrorist"


(I can't tell if it's CSC or Student Affairs or some other private security)


## Chancellor Block

Oct 13th 

“Only six days ago, a heinous assault was perpetrated upon Israeli civilians by the terror organization Hamas, a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly as well as the taking of innocent hostages. Earlier this week, I joined UC leadership in condemning this attack, and as new details have emerged, I can only denounce it further: This was a grievous act of malice and hate. It was, I am pained to say, the largest one-day killing of Jews since the end of the Holocaust.

Since then, Israel has responded to the assault, leading to a significant loss of Palestinian lives and the troubling displacement of large numbers of innocent individuals.”

“This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. **We must not devolve into violating one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911.**”

### r/UCLA

Oct 13th

"**How can we believe that the UC cares about both Palestinian lives and Israeli lives**, if the chancellor puts out this statement. "Grievous" "malice" "despicable" vs. "troubling". Are you joking?"

"They do care about all lives. However not denouncing Hamas when it's a well known terrorist group and a religious extremist group would be disgusting."

"You're directing attention away from the point. They denounced Hamas. I never said they shouldn't do so. However, they DID NOT denounce the ethnic cleansing that's been ensuing since. That's the point. I'm convinced you're choosing to be dense rn."

### Response SJP

Oct 16

"In Chancellor Gene Block's recent statement via mass email, the UC perpetuates Zionist rhetoric by justifying the brutal occupation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, naming the Zionist regime's genocidal attacks on Gaza as simply a response to "terrorist" attacks. **However, we know that Al-Aqsa Flood is not unprovoked.** It is a response to over 75 years of brutal Zionist colonization, occupation, ethnic cleansing, the denial of Palestinian refugees' right to return to their ancestral homeland, relentless attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque, and indiscriminate bombardment."


## UCLA policy

### The orthodoxy 

### UCLA philosophy and policy 

UCLA core mission is to protect academic freedom. 

Academic freedom is the **unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities**---the lifeblood of human evolution. While in "everyday" exchanges knowledge may be qualified for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety, this is a societal construct. **Truth is absolute.** This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

In the United States, free speech and academic freedom go hand in hand, they protect and facilitate one another, they are inextricably linked.

“The freedom to communicate (speech) and the (academic) freedom to inquire are both essential to the university’s fundamental mission, “which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it to its students and to society at large.””


“Does the First Amendment apply to UCLA? Yes, because as an extension of the California government, UCLA is a state actor. So, if UCLA constrains your freedom of speech, then the First Amendment most definitely applies.”

### SJP 

Their viewpoint is extreme but useful in understanding academic freedom. Why is a political position that sides with a known "terrorist" organization protected by the 1st Amendment? We use UCLA's "two way street" principle. The United States does not recognize Palestine as a sovereign nation, and any military group involved in the killing of innocent civilians are terrorists. Then what of the same activity that was sanctioned by the United States or its forefathers? If we define "terrorist" as the killing of innocent people over contested land, have we not also been "terrorists" at one time or another in our history? (For thousands of years) academic freedom reserves the right to study these ideas, free from oppression or persecution, free from what the government tells us. 

Therefore, if through the American lens Hamas are terrorists, but through a Palestinian lens Americans have been terrorists, or Israelis for that matter, then the word terrorist for moral purposes has lost all meaning. 

From an academic lens, there is no what they "are," based on societal qualification. There is only what they do and do not do. We understand any entity by the first principles of their actions based only in factual evidence. That is truth. 

### CAC and the non-affiliates


**“But as a descriptive statement of law, the assertion “hate speech is not free speech” is just plain wrong.** The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws—including university “speech codes”— that penalize or otherwise regulate “hate speech.””

However, the

“Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment…But this **means freedom of speech can sometimes be constrained to further the right to equality.** The reality—and challenge—is that sometimes equality gives way to freedom of speech, and vice versa.”

“**What counts as “harassment?”** 


“While there is some uncertainty in the law with respect to what counts as harassment, UCLA Student Conduct Code (Section 102.11) defines harassment as “conduct that **is so severe and/or pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so substantially impairs a person’s access to University programs or activities that the person is effectively denied equal access to the University’s resources and opportunities.**””

But, 

Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, **the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as “unprotected speech” and “less protected speech” narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future.**” (This is the civil liability standard not the Title VI standard)


It remains true that,

“Remember that **certain forms of speech, such as true threats and defamation**, are unprotected under the First Amendment. There’s a reason why these forms of speech are unprotected (or less protected); as a general rule, it’s understood that they cause concrete harm and provide little if any social value. **UCLA is largely free to regulate those forms of speech** and it should attempt to do so.”

## Hook 3

 Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

[Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"


## Chancellor Block

The Nov 8th incident warranted [condemnation by Block and Drake](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) on Nov 10th, although the previous incident was not explicitly condemned. 

Nov 10th

"Today, I joined University of California President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors in issuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses — including UCLA — over the past several weeks. We must be crystal clear: discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding."

"At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. **While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment**, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable."

### Response by a student in the Daily Bruin dated Nov 19

"“The Palestinian student said they were disappointed that an Oct. 13 statement by the chancellor described the Oct. 7 attack as a “grievous act of malice and hate” against Israelis but Palestinian deaths as “loss of life,” as the tonal shift emphasizes the violence against Israelis over Palestinians. 

They added that they feel **the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus** because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than Palestinian students.”"
