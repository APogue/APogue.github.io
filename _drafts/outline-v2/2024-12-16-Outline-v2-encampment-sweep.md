## hook 2

When the administration came to the decision to remove the encampment on May 1st after a week long protest turned violent the evening before, Darnell "Hunt told students that the reason for the decision was to protect student safety in the wake of the mob violence: "These police officers to my understanding were given the mandate to to clear out the encampment because of security risks."

When pushed, he said it was because of "the people that attacked you last night," saying "[t]he point is to shut down an unsafe situation because we think the people [referring to the mob] are going to come back and we don't know how many may come back"

Mr. Hunt conceded that the university initially supported student' rights to be at and maintain the encampment until the mob violence broke out, saying, "when this encampment set up, we did not move to dismantle it. In fact, we were working with you to keep it going until what happened last night." [source](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/blair_v_regents_complaint.pdf)
