The key theme is deliberate indifference 

- distinguish between ignorance and willful ignorance 

	- willful ignorance became its own problem and endangered students

- "Willful ignorance" refers to the act of deliberately choosing to avoid information or facts that could potentially be important or damaging, essentially deciding to remain uninformed on a subject despite having the ability to learn about it; it's often used when someone actively avoids knowledge to protect themselves from facing uncomfortable truths or potential consequences. 

**If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite “Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid” instead of just saying, “this was an unlawful obstruction”?**

- dog whistle? 

- they wanted to shut the encampment down 

**Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways and violence) to continue for days before acting? Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?**

- public perception, Irvine worked with students to make the encampments functional, it would look too hasty to shut them down immediately without trying to educate them on time, place, and manner

	- refresh on what happened with Irvine, he did call the cops on the students, but no one was hurt or arrested, and he maintained a rapport with them thereafter

- they didn't want to shut it down too soon, they were feigning free speech protections and following suit with other big universities 

**Why did UCLA ignore student safety concerns about antisemitism when no laws were broken, but suddenly take those concerns seriously when laws were technically violated?**

- because they did not want to address the unlawfulness 

- they did not want to assist in any way in making the encampment lawful 

**UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.**

- they used Jewish safety as the Trojan horse to infiltrate the encampment and shut it down 

When it came time to shut the encampment down on May 1st, there was no clear message to the university or the greater community as to why 

- do they believe the greater community only cares about Jewish students?

- regardless of how this group of students felt, they were unsafe 

	- find the info snippet on the backstory of how they were notified 

**What does it mean to "feel unsafe?"**

- are we defining "feeling unsafe" as bodily harm? or as exclusion? If it is the latter, then there were many instances where students would have rightfully  felt unsafe

- in fact there were many instances when students said explicitly that they felt unsafe 

Messaging to the UCLA community matters

- There are tens of thousands of undergraduate students and hundreds of thousands in the greater community

- Decisions cannot be ad hoc, especially in this day and age, when we have valuable policy and data-driven information 

- These are not trivial matters relating to a local high school pep rally

This wasn't a failure of resources it was a failure in judgement

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I need to develop and build to some kind of crescendo when it comes to the comparison of safety and policy as a function of time

"safety," or lack thereof presents itself as 

- USAC policy 

- discrimination 

- violence 

- exclusion 

14th amendment and title VI protections state that you can't deny access to education 

- UCLA was allowing students to violate policy under the guise of free speech protections 

- by blockading walkways large swaths of people were denied access to areas of campus and had to take detours to get to their classes

	- that's enough to say if it wasn't breaking Title VI or 14th amendment, that at the least they were breaking the time, place and manner laws 

	- they were not literally denying anyone access to an education 

- if people are violently harassed and/or sent to the hospital as a result of failures of UCLA policy

	- they are literally being denied access to their education 

- look at it in a purely content neutral way, rhetoric meant to make some number of students feel "safe" led to a larger number of students being made physically unsafe 

	- were the students made unsafe deserving of this fate? 

UCLA maintains a policy of 

- willful ignorance 

- heavy policing 

	- policing has always been a "point and shoot" tool

	- they never expected UCPD to handle policy 

	- they did when riots broke out 

- communications to the Jewish community 

- blame

- absent rhetoric 

	- they don't want to be seen as assisting any cause in any way

		- whether assistance is in the form of ideological promotion (the cover)

		- or assisting in stopping the nuisance that protests created 

		- or protection of student safety 

timeline 

- start at the encampment arrests

- backwards in time to the first half of the school year up to the start of the encampment

- crescendo at the violence at encampment 

- policing after encampment 

- forwards in time to June 10th protests and policing 

antisemitism

- Whose fault is it that antisemitism is happening on campus?

- It becomes a question of how much antisemitism is happening because the school is not enforcing policy

	- Forget whether its incumbent upon the students to initiate impeachment hearings

	- These students pay student fees to the school 

	- Are we throwing out the baby with the bathwater because honestly no one wants the baby either?

- JVP never interacted with CAC

	- JVP has been bullied and harassed 

	- This JVP is very different from Michigan, they are not radical, they do not push violent or hateful rhetoric

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I don’t want to start with the night that already got the most media coverage. Instead, I want to frame the reader’s mindset so that by the time they reach the riot, they fully grasp the institutional failures that led to it.**

Frame the Core Themes (Safety vs. Policy Over Time)

Events leading up to the encampment clearing - students were clearly denying students access to education by blockading pathways thereby breaking laws corresponding to time, place and manner rules, but Block framed it as a safety issue. 

Block made it clear in that moment his priority was to make the campus environment "safe" for all students

Did UCLA’s policies and decision-making create a safer campus?

Tell a story, from start to finish there should be three developing arcs:

**The Policy Arc: when was policy clearly applied or not clearly applied when it should have been**

**- formal policies on speech, protest and discrimination**

**The decision Arc: What were the decisions**

**- enacted in a reactive, selective, and deliberately vague way** 

**The results: what actually happened**

**- campus safety was never a first priority for any student**

**- campus was not equally safe for all students**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the overall Arc: 

something has to lead up to violence, what is the arc that leads up to violence? 

demonstrate a clear cause and effect, ucla was a catalyst for the ultimate firestorm 

- UCLA policy and decisions led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results left unattended led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results lead to violence 

- violence lead to blame, denial, and tone deaf policy

- blame, denial and tone deaf policy led to unsafe results 

- **unsafe results led to denial of education**  

- and round and round it goes 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
outside/inside 

before a scenario and after

scenario and similar flashback 

cause and effect map 

## The document design

the safety issues need to be the subject matter that structures the document 

- whatever details are important, can add depth or enrich the topic

it becomes a question of how to lay the safety issues out

- temporally 

- or via the crescendo 

- perhaps both 

## Big incidents

### The Kaplan incident violence arc 

- They're aware of misinformation spreading through the community -> posts on Twitter and death threats to English Dept. 

	- They're aware of the vast Jewish and pro-Israel connection with UCLA social media channels -> UCLA even posted ahead of the meeting to try to dispel rumors

- Even despite their best efforts to address "rumors" that did not change the violent outcome

	- It was the English Dept that opted to use an abundance of caution and move the teach in

- They witnessed the effect -> violence shown to students, and one parent

- Their solution had nothing to do with holding perpetrators accountable      

### The encampment violence arc

- they were aware of the blockading 

	- this became a big deal within the community (LA Times)

- they were aware of the violence 

- they did nothing for days 

- emboldened (the guy with the message on his phone), that was on April 30th, he was clearly not deterred because days of chaos were permitted to continue

- they sent a message to the community about the harm it was causing, choosing to say Jewish students were "afraid."

- they did not choose to publicly address the encampment, however the encampment did publicly respond 

- Block claimed it was due to security issues (congressional hearing), that's why he wanted to shut it down that day, but he never stated that to the students, and never bothered to warn them when they released the statement that they would stay

- there's also a video capture of someone saying "this is for blocking students and making them afraid" (reddit)

### The Sukkah for Gaza arc 

- So based on the above two incidents, there is a clear link between UCLA rhetoric and the greater community reaction, yet UCLA refuses to address such link 

- They have deployed a massive police force to ensure safety is maintained (cooling free speech)

- Maybe they have changed policy on rhetoric

- Or maybe they haven't, how will we ever know if they don't address it? Threats were already made in multiple forms to the Sukkah encampment

	- People coming to destroy the Sukkahs

	- A warning that counterprotesters would be depolyed if the protest was not shut down 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## UCLA upholds a "policy" of one-way communication 

### Media attention is driving responses

- Encampment communication's influence by media and the community was confirmed by the independent report

- reaction to encampment conduct made publicly, and directed at students

- reaction to pinata incident made publicly and directed at students 

- reaction to pig effigy made publicly and directed at students 

- at no point was there ever an explicit reaction to counterprotesters 

	- after the kaplan event

	- or during the April protest

- one-sided coverage serves to shape the public perception that only antisemitic incidents are happening 

- condemnation of only major incidents means

	- the school doesn't actually care about student welfare

	- the school and not the students is at fault for antisemitism on campus because they are not even trying to hold people accountable


### Administrative communication regarding encampment directives 

- If not incumbent on the university to uphold policy, then it was at least incumbent on them to warn students of the danger that they were in (like some sort of disclaimer)

	- Block sent a campus-wide statement saying that the encampment made students feel threatened and afraid

	- Block told the House Committee that security issues were why they cleared the encampment 

	- At no point was there a public, campus-wide notice addressing protesting students for the purposes of danger mitigation

		- Title IX addresses broad-reaching notification requirements, as opposed to Title VI where information need only be "made available," a lower standard for safety, communication of the law, and protection of rights. UCLA opted to make information available to protesting students without concern that only a subset of protesting students may be getting this information  

		- There was an unclear message in the form of a flyer that students needed to leave 

			- There was no clear message that students were engaging in unlawful obstruction or were in immediate danger

			- Because the message was not campus-wide, only a subset of students were guaranteed to have received it

		- Students groups responded by saying "we will not leave"

			- It should have been clear to UCLA (via constructive notice) that the encampment would not be vacated that evening

			- If they had really intended on having the encampment cleared, and they knew that it would not be, why not take further administrative or security steps to address the encampment? 

				- Because they chose deliberate indifference to the situation 

					- They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the status of their own students

					- They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the lack of police presence and backup that would be available to them 

						- Did they indicate to John Thomas, who was watching a Dodgers game that evening, 

							- That they'd sent a message to the greater community saying Jewish students were feeling threatened and afraid?

							- That the protesting students responded by saying they will not leave? 

					- Did they bother to check what kind of police presence was available that evening, in the event tensions escalated beyond the days before? (this is a question for Thomas directly)

### After the attack of April 30th 

- Block's message was, "however one feels about the encampment"

	- how is this a content-neutral approach? 

### Post-encampment notifications by UCLA

- It was incumbent on the university to notify students that they would be facing arrest

	- There was no clear message that continuing to camp on university grounds would result in arrest

		- Students within the encampment were told the afternoon before, in-person (by Hunt?)

		- The encampment was ambushed in the middle of the night 

			- There is no guarantee that all encampment students had adequate warning to leave or be arrested 

### The university ignored the safety of student protesters

- Block said that the blockading and exclusionary behavior was making students feel threatened and afraid

- How was it that he was unaware of the continuing harassment of the encampment, and that this harassment might make students feel threatened and afraid?

- Was it the case that these students "deserved" to feel threatened and afraid, was it the case that harassment of this nature could be expected and even understandable? 

	- What proportion of this harassment was deemed legal by the administration, all of it? 

		- True threats are not legal but will not necessarily result in police involvement 

	- If free speech was the problem, is free speech allowed on campus or not? 

	- If conduct was the problem, is the school going to enforce policy or not? 

- Block needed to take a position and choose rhetoric that would be **sure to ensure the safety of the largest number of students**

	- A very large number of students were feeling threatened and afraid at that point, including protesters that may or may not have been partaking in the blockading (or may or may not have been in support of the blockading)

	- **The only way** to ensure the safety of the largest number of students, would have been to issue a clear and immediate dispersal order to the encampment. That would have been the only "content-neutral" way to handle messaging 

- Why didn't they assist in ensuring areas of campus were not blocked? 

	- Did they care about clearing walkways for Jewish students and subjecting blockading students to student conduct hearings? 

	- If no, then did they care to notify the encampment of its unlawful obstruction?

	- If no, then did they care to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?

	- The university was content with allowing the blockading to go on for days, with no response 

		- During which time harassment by counter-protesters was becoming increasingly worse

		- Which could have contributed to the encampment's exclusionary behavior 

			- The university assisted in setting up barricades, officially 

	- The university's only official response was to shut the protest down using a confusing flyer and rhetoric that was sure to inflame already increasing tensions 

		- The Bruin stated that the Block had never called the encampment unlawful before 

		- Even if he were abundantly clear, the school waited so long to address encampment conduct, they had essentially trapped students and put them in harms way

		- (Need to ask Darnell Hunt and the students how their interactions went, it's possible he tried to communicate with them on the subject)


### UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.

- This might just have to be student safety

- Students, and the community want to see the school is not just acting when the spotlight is on them

- It might not be up to the administration to "sane wash" the movement, but if they genuinely care about the welfare of targeted students (on both sides), they would address issues as they arise (on both sides)

	- Title VI and that policy doc encourage UCLA's input to the marketplace of ideas

- Need a different way to address Jewish anxiety without making it about every little thing

	- Bella Brannon, while she appreciates the effort, she doesn't think it's enough (the Bruin)

	- The triangle thing might just be too trivial, especially because they were removed right away

		- Maybe by pointing out that students were beginning to feel anxiety on Day 1, that antisemitism was happening on Day 1

		- CAC's encouragement of the red triangle and pig imagery and associating it to Block
	
		- The details of the Alicia Verdugo impeachment call 

			- CAC had been a major problem all year, potentially a major contributor to tensions between students, yet the school did nothing to stop them or address student concerns

			- This kind of imagery was only supported by a subset of groups

- Task force report on antisemitism 

- Task force on anti-Muslim/Arab hate

- Survey - no one trusts the administration 

	- They made certain parts of the survey optional 

		- Run the numbers, but the issue is not how low the score was before, but more the fact that they seemed to have deliberately made questions that weren't performing optional (in the case of reporting discrimination and harassment it was a 6% increase)

		- Check most recent UCUES data

- The bruin article 

	- on antisemitism

	- on campus safety

	- on anti-muslim/arab hate

- Talk to students?  

	- Did UCLA ever try to address CAC (probably not)

- The organization that said if UCLA doesn't do something then they will (Sukkah)

- Along with zero statements made about Kaplan the incident, there were also no statements made about tracking down the perpetrators 

	- When the Bruin inquired directly, a low-level administrator answered 

	- The student said herself she saw one of them at a pro-Israel vigil at around 7 pm 

		- How would it feel to know that masked assailants who may have ID'd a student were now free to attend campus events and be on campus at any time
	
	- There has been no evidence that UCLA attempted to track down the individuals responsible (you need to check that with SJP)

- The administration never kept students abreast of the status of criminal investigations regarding any non-student criminal activity

	- It has always been incumbent on students to keep track of the status of ID'd individuals (that CNN and social media largely ID'd) who may be dangerous

### UCLA is attempting to mediate the campus climate using symbolic gestures 

- After the pig effigy incident, the school and Dan Gold (Hillel director) spoke publicly about an antisemitism on campus initiative 

- After the Kaplan incident, the school inquired to Dan Myers about involving current events into the "differences across borders" initiative 

- There are several more opt-in style initiatives that UCOP Drake and Block have also mentioned 

- They aren't listening to the students 

- Broad, vague responses do nothing to say to students "we see you"

- All engagement is reactionary, after the fact, and only for the media's sake 

- Block said he would educate on TPM policies "during orientation"

- Orientation happens once, and during an optional and expensive orientation weekend 

- Why didn't they stand with Hillel in condemning counterprotesters after Kaplan? 

	- The school is not taking positive voices from within the community and promoting them 

- The school never apologized to students 




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Policing 

### Post-encampment policing 

- Police conduct was not lawful and put students in danger 

	- I do not know if arrests were indiscriminate, I have to check that 

		- Because it has been the case before that students were kettled without an appropriate dispersal order

### police response regents meeting 

### police response April 28th 

### police response April 29th 

### police response encampment 

### Office of campus safety created

- They basically put bodyguards on protesting students

- The heavy policing is disproportionately affecting protesting students

### police response June 10th 

- reaction to June 10th protest, consistent with UCLA comms pattern 

## SAMs

### Kaplan incident 

### The encampment

### the 3rd party investigation 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Heavy policing is already a policy of the university 

- Open with an arresting scene - drop the reader into the moment of peak chaos. Use vivid descriptions, eyewitness accounts, and specific details to establish the stakes.

- Did they arrest indiscriminately, or was there a fair dispersal order?
