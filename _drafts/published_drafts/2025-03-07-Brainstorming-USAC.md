This file is under administrative calls for attention, a lack of administrative attention can make students feel unsafe.  

### Jewish Students Call for Administrative Help from UCLA - the Call Goes Unanswered 

- When USAC began excluding it was clear they were compromised 

	- Jewish students called out the exclusion (winter)

	- It goes against school policy to exclude

	- Jewish students pay student fees, USAC uses these fees 

- Evidence against (CAC) continued to pile up, how much needed to accumulate? (flashback to post-Oct 7th incident)

	- X posts

	- Hostile environment by totality of circumstances 

- Jewish students had to take it upon themselves; it was clear that CAC was compromised when verdugo stepped down

	- But they called for her impeachment earlier (petition)

	- It was an impeachable offense to be in the encampment

	- Based on no condemnations by USAC for any antisemitic behavior on campus, or for blockading or any behavior breaking the rules, it was clear they weren't going to address issues 

	- Yet Jewish students didn't manage to begin the hearing process until the following academic year, after Verdugo had been voted in again by the student body 

		- Jewish students don't even have the representation necessary to change voting outcomes

		- Why are such extreme measures necessary when behavior is clearly violating policy? 

- The university didn't bother to weed out bad apples, which served to inflame tensions between student factions (Eli Tsives, who mentioned Verdugo by name) 

	- While at the same time, before the riots, no counterprotesters were addressed, putting ALL protesting students in serious danger 

- After the riots, the university chose to single out and pursue charges against specific rioters (who social media and CNN made the effort to ID)

	- Even then, charges against the hoodie guy, could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (his charges were lowered to misdemeanor I think, need to follow up on that)

	- That amounts to approximately five people, out of hundreds who showed up with weapons, fireworks, and contributed to violence and harassment 

- Did all protesting students have this coming? 

	- The person's quote saying that the encampment "had it coming"
