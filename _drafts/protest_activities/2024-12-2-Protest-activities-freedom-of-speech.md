When neutrality protects no one, whose voices are truly being heard?"


### Hook 

"I'm going to rip your fucking head off

You motherfucker

You better fucking run from me terrorist"


These were the words students were met with while on their way to a classroom. The students immediately left. Luckily campus officials were there to prevent further escalation. Had they not been, this incident could have ended far worse. But what is far worse? 


It seems then the aggressors succeeded in getting what they wanted---to hurl insults, physically take belongings and throw them in the trash, and stop the students from accessing the classroom.







(I can't tell if it's CSC or Student Affairs or some other private security)

	- [Hillel condemned it](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyT4RrxPNJU/?img_index=2) 

	- Non-affiliates clearly broke the law, UCLA conduct policy and UCLA non-affiliate conduct policy, should have been

		- Arrested for intimidation, property damage, attempted assault characterized by bias 

		- Cited for harassment and disruption of university operations

		- No-contact order 

		- They were permitted to leave the premises 






- The story of Asil Yassine 

- [Police arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian students in L.A. The fallout continues, Aug. 2, 2024](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-02/ucla-usc-pomona-palestinian-protests)

"Since police arrested her twice this spring at UCLA...The university placed holds on her records and she still has not received her diploma. Without proof of her degree, her work this summer at a psychology office won’t count toward her license.

Yassine signed an agreement with UCLA to not violate its policies again, which lifted the hold on her records. But she still has not received her diploma or transcript.

“I don’t think the arrests will lead to charges against me but the cases are still in limbo over my head,” Yassine said. “But the degree issue will set back my license by at least six months.”"





### An event to illustrate freedom of speech







### An event to illustrate discrimination 

- March pig effigy incident

- UC Divest "shut it down" (police footage) [IG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C51p_t2SMCH/?hl=en)

	- UC Divest in the above claims that UCPD, LAPD, Culver City PD, and Santa Monica PD were all on the scene

	- 100 plus cops were there

- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

	- Made it into social media posts, Op-eds, news articles (which news articles?)

- photo of the statue 

	- considered discrimination based on the above definition

- [Mary Osako statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/campus-condemns-antisemitic-caricature-at-uc-regents-meeting)

	- True Bruin Values

	- Principles of community










































### Administrative position on free speech activities 

- Free speech and academic freedom 

	- "Under the First Amendment, universities—especially public ones like UCLA—must allow a broad range of political speech, including statements that may be deeply offensive or critical of certain groups or governments. The Supreme Court has historically protected even controversial or extreme speech, provided it doesn’t incite imminent violence or constitute a direct threat."
	
	- Qualification of knowledge for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety is a societal construct. Truth is absolute.

	- This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

	- Especially important with regard to unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities---the lifeblood of human evolution

	- Content neutrality, two-way street 

- In contention with 

	- 1st Amendment exceptions narrowly defined

		- True threats (give an example)

		- Defamation (give an example)

	- 14th Amendment rights (getting too heady, USAC stuff in this doc?)

		- Anti-discrimination policy

			- Harassment 

			- Severe and/or pervasive, must interfere with access to education 

		- Title VI 

			- Totality of circumstances

			- Rhetoric motivated by bias

	- Time, place, and manner

		- Content-neutral, what is applied to one must be applied to all

- UC/UCLA put into place distancing measures to protect it from liability

	- Positions on issues taken by student governments are not positions taken by the university (by PACAOS-63.00)

		- this can be grouped with USAC

	- Campus organizations must avoid unauthorized implication that it is sponsored or endorsed by the university (by PACAOS-70.70)

	- UC regents passed article J2

	- DB---stated that they do not moderate messaging of any UCLA org

	- DEI doc---Supreme Court defined extremely narrow exceptions for free speech






## Background and Context

- UCLA is the most popular university in the US by application 

- UCLA philosophy: 
	
	1. ["Academic freedom in its fullest terms"](https://www.ucla.edu/about/mission-and-values)

		- [1st amendment rights as a student at UCLA](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/file/b06df921-414c-4bed-bf48-b3889f4aea8b#:~:text=the%20campus%20has%20also%20been,opinions%20through%20speech%20and%20media)

		- Block's House Opening Remarks - constitutional freedoms above everything

		- This is where you talk about boycotting the Nazarian

		- Pop culture is also at war with intellectualism right now (including Musk and Shapiro)

	
	3. UCLA "expects" students to function autonomously using value systems in place




- How does UCLA policy and enforcement support the above? Where there is a lack of systems, what patterns have emerged? 

	- Policies, reporting, consequences

- [Antisemitic display](https://jewishjournal.com/community/369554/ucla-condemns-ugly-antisemitic-pig-display/) was a catalyst for discussion about ongoing issues with antisemitism on campus 

- Osako said "The protest has ended and the display has been removed." 

	- What is depicted in the display shows clear discrimination (by the above definitions)

	- Why did they wait for the protest to be over before removing it? 

- Incidents occurring on Nov 7th & 8th 

	- Nov 7th 

	- Nov 8th rally in support of Palestine

		- Students went viral for screaming hate speech

	- [Block and Drake respond](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california)

		- [Policy measures](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-michael-v-drake-md-opening-remarks-november-15-regents-meeting) function as symbolic gestures

		- No accountability efforts

			- Zero acknowledgement of non-affiliate problem

			- No compulsory incident reviews with persons involved

	- Vague promises of investigations and punishment 

		- [Non-affiliate policy](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs#:~:text=No%20non%2Daffiliate%20shall%20solicit,profit%20or%20otherwise%2C%20except%20as)

		- Incident of [aggressive harassment](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyTYyrwrue7/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=da38a384-7a44-4f57-8bd6-b2b95de70ae8) (IG post 10-12)

		- UCLA spokesperson [addresses the incident](https://dailybruin.com/2023/10/26/hundreds-of-ucla-students-participate-in-march-walkout-for-palestine) (Daily Bruin 10-27) at an event

			- This needs a follow-up inquiry, doubtful there is any info on it that is publicly available

		- There was *no statement made* by the UCLA administration or Gene Block

			- Block made a general statement about the Gaza conflict on 10-13

			- No statement is an act of condemnation of the students in and of itself 

			- Yet another exercise in the conflating of protected and unprotected student activity 

			- Only* Hillel [addressed the issue](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyT4RrxPNJU/?img_index=2) specifically (10-12)

	- Complete inaction with respect to organizational activity

		- Background and context

			- Establish the position of these organizations 

				- Protected activity

					- Qualification of this speech as abhorrent or not is irrelevant, it is protected 

					- They dispute the statehood of Israel

						- The broader picture shows more than interest in ending the Gaza conflict, or ending "occupation"

						- They use several mechanisms to undermine Israel's legitimacy 

		- Unprotected activity

		- Student grievances 
		
	- Events, rallies, and Demonstration handling faces criticism 

		- [Article](https://dailybruin.com/2023/12/05/ucla-faces-scrutiny-for-safety-issues-at-protests-for-israel-palestine) by the Bruin---*UCLA faces scrutiny for safety issues at protests for Israel, Palestine (12-5)*  

			- covers issues of slow responses from UCLA administration liaisons, security failure issues and imbalanced policing

			- "university does not restrict or control the views shared by student groups.”

				- this is their "blanket statement" that reserves them the right not to get involved even when discrimination and harassment are occurring 

	- Consequences

		- The implications of a failure to acknowledge emerging patterns
		
			- A toxic campus environment for Jewish students 

			- An unsafe campus environment for pro-Palestinian students

### Refresher Notes 

- (separate out the takes relating to Title VI for a dedicated doc?)

- There was next to no guidance on time, place, and manner restrictions and UCLA demonstration policies 

	- UCLA seemed deliberately vague (in the name of "freedoms protection?") with respect to appropriate protest conduct

		- This lead to students blockading other students, including Jewish and handicapped students

		- By the time UCLA told the students, the encampment became a serious security issue and had to be cleared 

- UCLA wants to address the symptoms---violence and safety or condemning discrimination---but they continue to ignore the deeper issues

- USAC can take political positions

	- the idea that they must be "inclusive" of everyone does not equate to "political correctness," their *ideas*, their *positions*, need not be inclusive of everyone

	- but they cannot *exclude* anyone that wants to participate, that is the line. E.g. if someone of Israeli origin does not believe Israel should exist, then they must be included if that's what they want

	- Therefor, UCLA would take the position, that regardless of what CAC's constitution implies, their X posts are within the codes of conduct 

	- However, once they began discriminating, we can view these positions as contributing to a *hostile environment* because they are motivated by bias. Thus they are in violation of Title VI by totality of circumstances. 

- There are 2 issues at hand

	- UC policy---no one can be denied on any grounds

	- Title VI---no one can be denied benefits where discrimination is occurring 

- The encampment would not allow "Zionists" through. What is the definition? They were deliberately vague. There was no evidence to suggest that "Zionist" did not mean an individual who believes in Israel's statehood. 

	- Is this a Title VI violation? Technically, no. Discrimination based on national origin by its "purest" definition would be hating someone of Israeli origin whether or not they believe the state should exist. They did not exclude anyone based purely on their national origin. 

	- This clearly is a violation of UC policy, more specifically---

		- Based on an obligation to pay student fees, there is a de facto contractual agreement in place, that should someone decide to go to UCLA

			- They must renounce Israel to do so

	- This is a violation of Title VI---

		- Based on an obligation to pay student fees, there is a de facto contractual agreement in place, that should someone be Jewish and decide to go to UCLA

			- The student gov't and associated organizations will side against them, i.e *exclude* them

				- Go through every resolution, count the frequency that Jewish students are mentioned

				- Compare this with years past

		- Discrimination was occurring inside the encampment (red triangles)

		- UC, like Michigan, willfully conflates Title VI protected and unprotected activity

		- Where unprotected activity exists, *there must be a coordinator in place* to receive constructive notice and to determine whether a hostile environment exists based on totality of circumstances (this doesn't need to be pushed, this should be a retelling through a facts lens only)

- Where did USAC mess up

	- When they did not respond to Hillel---denied benefits

	- When they participated in the encampment---denied benefits

	- When they would not condemn discriminating behavior 
	
		- CAC, UC Divest, general campus climate activity (evidence coming out of task force reports) etc. 

		- Encampment exclusion activities 

		- Involvement of their own organizations, CAC and the other USAC org, in the encampment while they partook in exclusion---internal accountability 

		- They have in the past condemned antisemitism happening elsewhere in the country. They can't condemn it occurring on their own campus? Isn't it their job to be working on behalf of *all* the students? 

	- When they partook in discriminating behavior

		- CAC discriminates

		- We would assume USAC had constructive notice of CAC's activity via direct call outs by DB and Hillel, their own Insta activity

		- They took no measures to hold CAC accountable via impeachment hearings---corruption

- They're treating student gov't like a club that a group of friends belong to (cronyism). How can anyone take them seriously? 

- This is related to UC philosophy cultivating a microcosm of corruption.

Thesis1: The philosophy of the school is handling that is **content-neutral**

Thesis2: The philosophy of the schools is the support of **academic freedom**

Thesis3: The philosophy of the school is **freedom of speech**

Thesis4: Free speech is not an unconditional constitutional right

Thesis5: Free speech activities are subject to **time, place, and manner restrictions**

Thesis6: Free speech activities will be **forcibly disrupted** if they interfere with university operations
