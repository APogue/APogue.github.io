### A hostile environment by totality of circumstances 

- This is where the symbology and random antisemitic incidents should go towards the total

	- From the lawsuit

	- From the task force report


- Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

	- [Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"


### Illustrate free speech, treated as protected 

- Extreme political positions

	- Moshiach flag guy 

	- [Example 2, Oct 30th](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17k6sx8/islamophobes_on_campus/)

- May cause tensions to flare, UCLA won't get involved 

	- February rally 

		- Heckling 


### UCAC lack of condemnation of student orgs and members

- UC Divest "shut it down" (police footage) [IG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C51p_t2SMCH/?hl=en)

	- UC Divest in the above claims that UCPD, LAPD, Culver City PD, and Santa Monica PD were all on the scene

	- 100 plus cops were there
	

### Illustrate free speech, unprotected---treated as a gray area

- When "equal rights give way to free speech"---UCLA permits more extreme cases of discrimination

	- Given the state of campus climate, by totality of circumstances, removal was appropriate 

		- Did not remove it, waited to condemn it 

		- Did not hold anyone accountable (UC Divest)

	- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

		- Made it into social media posts, Op-eds, news articles (which news articles?)

- The April 30th protest was a hotbed for hate speech and discrimination 

	- Instances of discrimination quietly removed

		- Students mentioned they wanted to leave campus due to "clear signs of discrimination" happening 

		- Triangles made it into several articles as the "face of the protest"
	
		- No acknowledgment


### Fact checks

- [Atrocities of Oct 7th](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/10/what-we-know-about-three-widespread-israel-hamas-war-claims/)

- [Bisan Owda](https://www.thewrap.com/bisan-owda-emmy-israel-gaza-idf-executions-claim/), unsubstantiated 

- [Propaganda on the number of Palestinians killed](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA2Um1qR26B/?hl=en&img_index=2)

	- Versus Congressional Research Service, updated Oct 4th, "**Conflict, humanitarian situation, and international action.** In the conflict to date, more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry there. Additionally, about 90% of Gaza’s some 2.1 million residents have been displaced, with most facing unsanitary, overcrowded conditions alongside acute shortages of food, water, medical care, and other essential supplies and services. Obstacles to transporting aid through crossings and Israeli checkpoints and then safely delivering it have contributed to high levels of food insecurity. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) as of August 2024, humanitarian aid was probably preventing famine, but “hunger and malnutrition remain dire, and hunger-related mortality is likely still occurring.”"

- [Facebook and Insta restrict red triangle usage](https://www.instagram.com/muslim/p/DA55NaXOU0x/?img_index=1)

	- Association with Hamas, the red triangle is a "military target"

	- Association with concentration camps

	- Trump's ads were pulled 

- Has CAC created an observable pattern of messaging that, 

	- Promotes unverified, negative claims about Israel (e.g., accusations of atrocities without evidence),

	- Frames violent acts against Israelis as justified “resistance,” and

	- Perpetuates narratives that cast Israelis or Jewish students as complicit in perceived injustices,

		- This also applies to white supremacy, not "benefited from" but if she calls someone who is white a white supremacist 

- [UCLABIPAC](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/)

	- "There is so much propaganda that those are quote-unquote Israelis, those are settlers."

	- Denial of benefits

- "Exactly. By making Israeli = Settler and Settler = Zionist, the logic becomes transitive: Israeli = Zionist. This framing effectively removes any distinction between national identity and political ideology, equating simply being Israeli with adherence to a specific political stance (Zionism) and even further, with the idea of being a “settler.”"

- Blurring of Identity and Ideology:

	- This approach collapses nationality into ideology, treating anyone who is Israeli as inherently supportive of Zionist policies, regardless of their personal beliefs or political stance. It ignores the diversity of thought within Israel, where there is a wide spectrum of perspectives on issues like the occupation, settlements, and peace with Palestinians. It also misrepresents the reality of Jewish and Israeli identities, which can’t be neatly categorized by political ideology, as Zionism itself has multiple interpretations.

	- By labeling all Israelis as “settlers,” proponents of this view essentially reject Zionism in any form---not just the presence of Israelis in the West Bank or Gaza, but the idea of the state of Israel.

	- This view, while critical of Zionism, extends beyond policy disagreements and touches on identity. By conflating Israeli identity with Zionism and settler-colonialism, it labels all Israelis as participants in a colonial project, regardless of their individual beliefs, actions, or even ethnic background.

		- It is theoretically possible that there exists Israelis who believe in the dissolution of the Israeli state 

- Equate it to American:

	- American = Settler = Deserving of harm at the hands of the original inhabitants of this land. Then by the same logic this individual also deserves to die. 

- Defined logical implication that all Israelis are Zionists:

	- In this framework, to be Israeli is equated with being a Zionist inherently. The logic is that any Israeli presence in the land, regardless of location or borders, represents Zionism or “settler colonialism.” This view rejects the idea that someone can be Israeli without being a Zionist, meaning it dismisses the possibility of Israelis who might be critical of Zionist policies, supportive of Palestinian rights, or against the occupation. Essentially, it equates national identity with ideology, with no room for variation.

### Quotes 

- “Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by 	the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and 			Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. ‘I feel very uncomfortable,’ he said. ‘I might skip my 		classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on 			campus.’” [Student onlookers express differing opinions on pro-Palestine encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment)


- [Unmasking counterprotesters who attacked UCLA’s pro-Palestine encampment](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html)

	- "‘You guys are about to get f—ed up’
	In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment."




### Notes

- Students started blockading pathways and excluding students

	- insta, tiktok 

- Then UCLA stepped in (this is the tie in with "UCLA handling doc")

	- No condemnation of hate speech 

	- Allows the sides to become embroiled in conflict 

- [UCLA faces scrutiny for safety issues at protests for Israel, Palestine](https://dailybruin.com/2023/12/05/ucla-faces-scrutiny-for-safety-issues-at-protests-for-israel-palestine)

	- Additionally, at recent protests in support of Palestine, protesters have chanted phrases such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” and “Resistance is justified when people are occupied.” Some members of the campus community said they were concerned that the chants were antisemitic.

	- However, Vazquez said in the statement that the university does not restrict or control the views shared by student groups.
