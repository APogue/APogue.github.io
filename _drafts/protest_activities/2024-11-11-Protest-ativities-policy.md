### Notes

- Policy that works requires *balance*. Anti-discrimination education that serves everyone. Policing that targets actual problems using the appropriate amount of resources. Free speech that acknowledges anti-discrimination laws.

- Umbrella responses unfairly target certain groups, chill free speech, and leave certain members of the community vulnerable to continual harm. 

- It is very convenient for the school to support 1st amendment rights in the manner that it is---by doing nothing. The school can uphold the 1st amendment in a way that is legal, which would take significantly more involvement and oversight. They would need to be more than "just a bank that holds classes sometimes" or whatever that students said

	- It is clear this is happening because even when they were tasked with implementing policy, they failed to do so and simply threw money at the problem after disaster struck

- [Proposed changes to Universitywide Police Policies and Administrative Procedures](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/gold-book-systemwide-review.pdf)

	- "The “Systemwide Response Teams” policy was drafted based on recommendation by the Robinson/Edley report
	to create specialized response teams to respond to crown management situations. A proposed Systemwide
	Response Team policy underwent Management Consultation in 2017, as well as review by the
	UCFW. However, it was put on hold pending the recommendations of the President’s Police Task Force"

	- Teresa Watanabe, education reporter for the LA Times: "And in fact, UCLA has upped up its request. I mean, their request for 3000 pepper balls was doubling their inventory of 1600. They also doubled their request for sponge projectiles, which can be very, very harmful. I know of one UCLA student who was shot in the chest with one of these, and spent two days in the hospital. So they're not saying it's for the protests upcoming, but everyone is concerned that they will be."

	- "UCLA police are requesting up to 3,000 more pepper balls to add to their inventory of 1,600; up to 400 more sponge and foam rounds, double the current stockpile of 200; eight more projectile launchers and three new drones."

		- "The UC Board of Regents’ Compliance and Audit Committee approved the allocation of drones, tear gas and less-than-lethal weapons to UCPD on Thursday.

		The board authorized the allocation of three drones, 3,000 rounds of pepper bullets and eight munition launchers to the UCLA police department...

		Under California Assembly Bill 481, UCPD must receive approval of a Military Equipment Use Policy by the UC Board of Regents prior to the “funding, acquisition, or use of military equipment.”"

		- "**UCLA police requested the most equipment out of all UC campuses and a larger amount than it did the previous year.** In 2023, UCLA solely requested sponge bullets, in comparison to its **2024 request of sponge bullets, pepper bullets, launchers, drones and tear gas.**"

		- UC Office of the President spokesperson Stett Holbrook: "“In spite of the nomenclature in AB 481, UCPD’s equipment is not military surplus, nor is it military-grade or designed for military use,” Holbrook said in the statement. “The University’s use of this equipment provides UC police officers with non-lethal alternatives to standard-issue firearms, enabling them to de-escalate situations and respond without the use of deadly force.”"

	- "The equipment that falls within the scope of AB 481’s definition of military equipment provides
	UCPD with less lethal alternatives to standard-issue firearms, for use in extraordinary public
	circumstances."

### Public safety policy 

- [UC Community Safety Plan](https://www.ucop.edu/uc-operations/systemwide-community-safety/policies-and-guidance/community-safety-plan/uc-community-safety-plan.pdf)

	- Introduction has 4 overarching guidelines, includes "bias/hate response"

	- Office of Systemwide Community Safety established in July 2022 to ensure the plan's implementation

- [UC’s President had a Plan to De-Escalate Protests. How did a Night of Violence Happen at UCLA?](https://www.kqed.org/news/11984762/ucs-campus-safety-plan-under-fire-as-violence-breaks-out-at-ucla-protest)

	- "The reason for such a mixed response from law enforcement is haphazard adherence to UC President Michael Drake’s 2021 UC Campus Safety Plan.

		Encampments at a growing number of universities across the state and nation are sparking battles between students’ free speech and campus policies against trespassing and obstructing operations. For the University of California system, the encampments at five campuses have been a test of newly implemented campus policing reforms meant to address systemic racism post-2020.

		Drake’s safety plan states: “The University will reinforce existing guidelines that minimize police presence at protests, follow de-escalation methods in the event of violence and seek non-urgent mutual aid first from UC campuses before calling outside law enforcement agencies.”"

	- "The 2021 safety plan instituted data dashboards, police advisory boards, mental health responders and professional accreditation for individual police departments. According to the UC’s director of community safety, Jody Stiger, all 10 campuses are expected to put the plan into action — with the final, delayed step being professional accreditation for campus law enforcement agencies — by the end of this year."

		- Says this plan instituted as a reaction to 2011 Occupy Wall Street and 2020 activism over George Floyd

- [Charting a new course for public safety at UCLA: Report of the UCLA Co-Chairs](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/Public-Safety-Report), May 10th 2022

- [Robinson/Edley Report](https://campusprotestreport.universityofcalifornia.edu/documents/implementation-report.pdf)

- [Robinson-Edley Report](https://campusprotestreport.universityofcalifornia.edu/), implementation report above is the promise to use the policy

	- Unlike the other schools, UCLA gave the impression they had all necessary systems in place. There was mention of training and an "Incident Command System" they were pursuing at the time. Can't find any "Incident Command System" associated with UCLA. 

- [Principles, Policies, and Practices: A toolkit to prepare for and manage major campus events or incidents](https://diversity.universityofcalifornia.edu/files/uc-major-events-toolkit-2024-update-003.pdf)

	- "A campus can have the most expertly crafted rules and regulations but, if they are not
	implemented with uniformity, they are rendered ineffective and the university’s credibility
	is compromised. This can be something as small as allowing one student group to use a
	loudspeaker and prohibiting another student group from doing the same."

	- "Regardless of whether one has a legal right to speak in a manner that reflects bias,
	stereotypes, prejudice and intolerance, each member of the University community is
	expected to consider his or her responsibilities as well as his or her rights.
	Intellectual and creative expression that is intended to shock has a place in our
	community. Nevertheless, mutual respect and civility within debate and dialogue
	advance the mission of the University, advance each of us as learners and teachers,
	and advance a democratic society"

	- "In August 2021, UC President Michael V. Drake, M.D., issued the UC Community Safety
	Plan to provide a systemwide framework for improving safety on UC campuses and
	ensuring that all members of the UC community feel welcome, respected, and protected
	from harm. Building on the work of prior UC safety initiatives, the Community Safety
	Plan broadly defines safety. It establishes mechanisms for empowering the UC
	community, developing a structure for continuous improvement, and ensuring that the
	University's safety policies and practices reflect the needs and values of our diverse
	community, including wellness, mental health, basic needs, and social services."

	- "There is no exception from the First Amendment on the basis of the hateful
	nature of a speaker’s statements. On its own, the fact that speech may cause
	emotional harm to others cannot provide the basis for UC to prohibit it"

	- "**The Robinson/Edley Report** continues to guide responses to protests and civil disobedience,
	while the **Community Safety Plan** establishes a structure for the University to achieve a
	more holistic approach to campus safety. "

		- "Of particular interest in the current era are the “Recommendations as Implemented” on pages 14–17 of the Robinson Edley Report - 12 Month Implementation Report, which refined the original recommendations based on input from university stakeholders."

	- " Regulations Governing Conduct of Non-Affiliates in the Buildings and
	on the Grounds of the University of California (100013.L) state that no
	non-affiliate shall wear a mask, personal disguise or otherwise conceal
	their identity with the intent of intimidation or for the purpose of
	vading identification."

	- "Regulations Governing Conduct of Non-Affiliates in the Buildings and
	on the Grounds of the University of California (100008 and 100015)
	indicate that no non-affiliate shall bring any explosive, flammable or
	hazardous materials onto university property. No non-affiliate shall
	carry or possess any Dangerous Weapon — see Section 100015 for the
	definition of “Dangerous Weapon.”"

	- "PUBLIC SAFETY AND PROTEST MANAGEMENT"---lists things campus should be doing. Has UCLA been doing any of it?

		- "Has the campus established a clear process for consulting with the Chancellor
	or a designate on the use of policing tactics, including use of force, removal
	of protestors, citation or arrest of protestors? (response continuum - do you
	have one, who is in charge of it?)"

	- "COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING PROTESTS AND MAJOR EVENTS"

		- "**Have campus officials made every reasonable attempt to identify and contact
	members of the demonstration group — preferably one or more group leaders
	— in advance of the demonstration, to establish lines of communication?** For
	leaderless groups, campus authorities should consider communicating
	broadly to the group as a whole (through social media and otherwise) until
	relationships form."

	means including, but not limited to, electronic media, such as the internet, social
	networks, cell phones, texts, and other devices or forms of contact."

		- "Training and Education for the Respondent:

	- "Any member of the university community who is arrested for unlawful behavior or cited for a violation of university policy must go through the applicable review process, such as student code of conduct or employee disciplinary process.

		The Regents further affirmed that amnesty for students, faculty and staff is inconsistent with this guideline."

	- "UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said UCPD will enforce campus policy banning people from setting up tents on campus property but only if and when they can do so “safely and effectively.” “We don’t want a repeat of the conflicts that marred last semester’s events,” Mogulof said. When tents were erected on campus during the Nov. 9 Occupy Cal protest, police officers physically confronted hundreds of protesters, making arrests, taking down the tents and injuring several people. In response to the Albany occupation, the university turned off the water supply that provides irrigation to the land. “This land is"

	- "24 students and community members filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against UC Berkeley administrators and police, alleging excessive force and violations of free speech rights. In 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the police brutality claims, stating that the officers' use of force was minimal and that university officials were not liable."

	- "The settlement should be a wake-up call for other universities and police departments," said Michael Risher, staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. "If the First Amendment means anything, it's that you should be able to demonstrate without being afraid of police violence."

	- This is the incident that led to the Robinson/Edley report, it occurred at Davis




### Free speech policy 
 
- [Free Speech on Campus: The Basics, The Myths, The Challenges](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/free-speech-on-campus)

	-  Defamation (false statements of fact published with a particularly reckless state of
	mind that harms reputation) and harassment (sexual, racial, etc) are categorical exceptions to free speech

	- "The following pages offer a point of departure for this journey. This isn’t legal advice. It’s not even meant as official University policy. It’s instead the start of a public conversation. Our analysis is incomplete, a work-in-progress, consistent with the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion’s ethos that embraces reflection, revision, and reiteration."

	- "Does the First Amendment apply to UCLA? Yes, because as an extension of the California government, **UCLA is a state actor. So, if UCLA constrains your freedom of speech, then the First Amendment most definitely applies.**"

	- "Of course, UCLA should do everything possible to ensure that those disagreements are debated on-the-merits, with clarifications, concessions, persuasion, and respect. But the bottom line is that we want that diversity of viewpoints to be aired, debated, and considered, not trapped inside single-minded echo chambers."

	- "The freedom to communicate (speech) and the (academic) freedom to inquire are both essential to the university’s fundamental mission, “which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it to its students and to society at large.”"

	- "But as a descriptive statement of law, **the assertion “hate speech is not free speech” is just plain wrong.** The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws—including university “speech codes”— that penalize or otherwise regulate “hate speech.”"

	- "Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as “unprotected speech” and “less protected speech” narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future."

	- They understand and acknowledge that truth does not always prevail in the marketplace of ideas

	- "Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment...**But this means freedom of speech can sometimes be constrained to further the right to equality. The reality—and challenge—is that sometimes equality gives way to freedom of speech, and vice versa.**"

	- "And most important, what counts as “harassment?” Those who seek to create a whole new exception or increase the scope of recognized exceptions face an uphill battle. For good or bad, the Supreme Court has interpreted what counts as “unprotected speech” and “less protected speech” narrowly and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future."

	- "Remember that certain forms of speech, such as **true threats and defamation**, are unprotected under the First Amendment. There’s a reason why these forms of speech are unprotected (or less protected); as a general rule, it’s understood that they cause concrete harm and provide little if any social value. **UCLA is largely free to regulate those forms of speech and it should attempt to do so.**"

	- "UCLA Student Conduct Code (Section 102.11) defines harassment as **“conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so substantially impairs a person’s access to University programs or activities that the person is effectively denied equal access to the University’s resources and opportunities.**”"

	- "That amounts to a **“Heckler’s Veto,” which the University frowns upon and First Amendment law does not protect.**"

	- "Even though UCLA as “sovereign” cannot suppress speech simply because it disagrees with its message, UCLA as “speaker” may pick a side and share its beliefs. UCLA can, and should, exercise the full power of its bully pulpit to speak our values...This includes publicly denouncing hate speech, whether that speech is expressed by members of the UCLA community or by those invited into our fold."

	- "**Geat ideas, great art, and great teaching should often make us uncomfortable.**"

	- "In addition, UCLA should continue its efforts to diversify the university; to facilitate the development of programmatic and curricular initiatives that advance and reflect its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion; and proactively work to ensure that no student feels barred from participating in the multiple dimensions of campus life because of their social group membership."

- "Anna Markowitz, an associate professor of education, said the heavy presence of officers standing around “in little packs” made the campus less comfortable, ramping up tensions and the potential for racial profiling. Another faculty member said he was shocked to count 14 officers in a half-mile walk through campus."

	- "“What’s the plan to get rid of this?” Markowitz said she asked at recent Academic Senate town hall with Braziel and Interim Chancellor Darnell Hunt. “Is there a plan?”"

	- "Braziel’s response during the town hall — putting security officers in friendlier blue-and-gold UCLA polo shirts instead of the black shirts that many currently wear — did not play well among faculty, who said he missed their larger concerns of the tense campus climate created by the stepped-up patrols."

		- "It is the intent of the Legislature that the University of California foster freedom of expression and the free exchange of ideas that comply with state and federal law and campus policies, while also protecting student, staff, and faculty safety and access to campus spaces and educational opportunities. As a condition of receiving $50,000,000 of state financial assistance, campuses shall develop campus climate action plans by the beginning of the Fall 2024 term and prominently post and distribute the plan to students upon arrival on campus each academic year. These plans shall include information such as the institution’s time, place, and manner restrictions for protests or activities, policies regarding campus safety, and how campuses will foster healthy discourse in a manner that promotes the educational mission of the University. The Office of the President of the University of California shall submit a report to the Legislature by Oct. 1, 2024, describing the campus climate action plans."

Each campus of the university shall prepare a campus climate notification by the beginning of the Fall 2024 term. The University of California Office of the President will develop a systemwide framework to provide for consistency with campus implementation and enforcement.

			(6)	How the campus may respond to activities that threaten the safety of students, faculty, or staff, and disrupt their ability to access the campus or buildings, the educational process, or activities on campus. The notification will include strategies consistent with current law for how the university intends to ensure students can safely access buildings and activities on campus."

	- "SB 1287 (Glazer): Protecting Free Speech at Institutions of Higher Education

		This bill requires colleges and universities to update and enforce student codes of conduct to better prevent violence, harassment, intimidation, and discrimination that is intended to interfere with free speech and other constitutionally-protected rights.

		AB 2925 (Friedman): Including Jews and Antisemitism in DEI Training

		This bill requires that any campus that chooses to provide DEI training must include training about discrimination against the groups most likely to be targets of hate – which includes the Jewish community. 

		 
		AB 3024 (Ward): Stop Hate Littering Act

		This bill seeks to prevent the distribution of hateful flyers, posters, or symbols that are intended to terrorize vulnerable communities. Hate littering is a tactic of harassment and intimidation that has been targeting Jewish communities and neighborhoods with large Jewish populations around California.  Reporting from Jewish community media organizations have found the practice to have proliferated in almost all regions of California as well as spreading nationally.  As recently as last month, disturbing antisemitic flyers were found on driveways of Jewish families throughout the East Bay and in neighborhoods of San Diego.

		 
		SB 1277 (Stern): Teachers Collaborative for Holocaust and Genocide Education

		This bill codifies the California Teachers Collaborative for Holocaust and Genocide Education as a statewide professional development program for teachers under the Department of Education. The Collaborative will focus on the Holocaust and other genocides, as well as identifying and confronting hate and antisemitism in modern society."
