The red triangle symbol first began with CAC

The rules and policy can be integrated into the story 

### Background 

2. Self-governance

	- UCLA takes a very hands-off approach to guidance and oversight based on these principles 

		- Positions on issues taken by student governments are not positions taken by the university (by PACAOS-63.00)

	- USAC has a set of [bylaws](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/6641d05eb7443b3f12156677/1715994667939/bylaws.2023-05-09.pdf#page=1) 

		- I.D. Conflict of Interest

			- Discrimination represents a conflict of interest when involved in political activity 

		- I.E. Discrimination

			- "All grievances shall be handled with the following procedure: First, an appeal to the office or commissioner shall be made. If the plaintiff is dissatisfied, then an appeal can be made to the Judicial Board.The Council shall by three-fourths(3/4) vote of its entire voting membership be able to override the Judicial Board decision."

		- III.B.4 Guidelines for Council Student Group Sponsorship

			- "No Council sponsored group shall at any time promote discrimination with regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion. It should be understood that if a group commits an act that violates this guideline, then that group shall be subject to sanctions imposed by the Council which may lead to de-sponsorship."

	- UC student government has the [right to take positions on public issues](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710526/PACAOS-60)

	- UCLA USAC's own constitution is more specific in limiting powers

		- USAC [constitution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/6509389145a9b930a19e0401/1695103121405/USA+Constitution.pdf)

			- Preamble

			- I.D. USAC shall not participate in discrimination 

			- II.B.3.a. 

				- rights of students to participate in all activities 

				- rights of students to a fair hearing of grievances

	- [Group misconduct](https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/group-student-code)

		- Section II. Definitions, Section K, *Student Group*

			- *USAC* 

				- Section III.B, *Types of Misconduct* includes 202.11, *Discrimination and Harassment*

					- 202.11a *Discrimination*

						- "Discrimination means the exclusion of a person, on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion,...from participation in any academic, research or other University service, program or activity."

					- 202.11b *Harassment*

						- "Harassment means conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent so as to interfere with or limit an individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities or opportunities offered by the University, or creates a work environment that is intimidating, hostile or abusive."

	- USAC charges [mandatory fees](https://sole.ucla.edu/file/cfdd57d7-15e0-4d9d-a6bf-e5ce5e91e385) from student tuition in order to run a large portion of undergraduate life

		- [not all fees are at USAC discretion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/mtr3ns/what_is_usac_a_sort_of_brief_guide/)

			- [fee breakdown](https://www.usac.ucla.edu/funding/student-fee)

			- [more recent fees paid number](https://sa.ucla.edu/RO/Fees/Public/public-fees?year=2023-2024&term=Annual&degree=Undergraduate%20cohort%202023-24)

			- [86.11 *Conditions for Support*](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710528/PACAOS-80) "Particular
			programs and activities of a Registered Campus Organization funded from compulsory
			campus-based student fees shall be open to participation by the entire campus
			community."



### Context 

- The situation in Palestine has been on the Council's radar for a while 

	- [Myers opposes](https://dailybruin.com/2014/05/23/submission-usac-ethics-statement-exacerbates-israeli-palestinian-situation) a proposed pledge (2014) that would ban students from taking trips to Israel sponsored by certain groups 

		- "But like Chancellor Gene Block, I don’t think that the Undergraduate Students Association Council should legislate who can or cannot travel abroad – or where."

- Case of antisemitism 

	- Reemergence of what the author believes is the "Jewish Question", [TDB](https://dailybruin.com/2015/03/09/submission-ucla-campus-must-take-action-to-address-anti-semitism)

		- Find the video on this 

- [Efforts](https://dailybruin.com/2018/11/18/national-students-for-justice-in-palestine-conference-goes-on-despite-on-campus-protest) to suppress speech in the past have been answered by USAC

	- [Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/65093f0232032a4edc39b4f9/1695104770978/A+Resolution+In+Favor+of+Equalized+Access+to+UCLA+for+Non-Commerical+Speech+Events%3B+Specifically+in+Regards+to+SJP.pdf) for equal access 

- [Resolutions](https://www.usac.ucla.edu/documents/resolutions) in the past have condemned antisemitism (****Verdugo was on the council during 2021-2022 year when the last Resolution condemning antisemitism was passed) 

	- "[A Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/65093b574272311736b89fac/1695103831148/A+Resolution+In+Support+of+Jewish+Students+Amidst+Rising+Antisemitism.pdf) in Support of Jewish Students Amidst Rising Antisemitism"


### CAC is the core of the problem 

- Shortly after Oct 7th 

	- CAC

		- [Mission](https://prod.community.ucla.systems/studentorg/623)

		- [Position](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMSRCuSlAR/?hl=en&img_index=1) on Oct 7th

			- "River to the Sea"

			- "Honoring Palestinians on the front lines"

		- Red triangles emerge in a post that they share (evidence in the lawsuit doc)

		- [Facebook and Insta restrict red triangle usage](https://www.instagram.com/muslim/p/DA55NaXOU0x/?img_index=1)

			- Association with Hamas, the red triangle is a "military target"

			- Association with concentration camps

			- Trump's ads were pulled 

			- The original material CAC shared was pulled and replaced without triangles

	- As CAC Commissioner she is regularly involved with gov't resolutions involving Israel

		- USAC February Resolution

			- [USAC passes resolution endorsing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement](https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/21/usac-passes-resolution-endorsing-boycott-divest-and-sanctions-movement)

			- [USAC Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/663f458d5f90ea7b2468c313/1715422605926/resolution.2024-02-20.A+Resolution+to+Boycott+and+Divest+from+Apartheid,+Ethnic+Cleansing,+and+Genocide.pdf)

				- Broad with respect to Israel

				- Resolution was sponsored by Verdugo, 10-3 vote to pass on 2-20

				- Evidence of connection with UCLA BDS

	- [UCLABIPAC IG message](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3a68r6uAHC/?igsh=ZWMyNDBlOTQyNg%3D%3D&img_index=1) 

		- Labeled as "calls for impeachment" and published in the [Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com/2024/02/21/usac-passes-resolution-endorsing-boycott-divest-and-sanctions-movement) (who did not endorse her for the 24-25 year) on 2-21

		- Shows examples of discriminatory behavior on the part of Verdugo

	- There is no social media evidence* that CAC will work with JVP or vice versa

		- Beyond political positions, the lack of a relationship shows that either CAC does not want to work with JVP based on Jewish identity or JVP agrees they are involved in discriminatory behavior


### The Protests

- USAC presence

	- CAC and CEC were [present](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/29/candidates-in-upcoming-usac-elections-participate-in-solidarity-encampment) 

		- [photo](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/27/gallery-ucla-students-supporting-palestine-organize-encampment-in-dickson-plaza) of both tents

		- CAC promoted their presence there in an IG [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6M4IM1v3LI/?hl=en&img_index=4)

	- Criticism of Verdugo

		- [Eli Tsives](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6WseJ2Jp3x/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=48470d69-c9e4-4a25-86b0-1efaa3c285de) who was also blocked, expressed disapproval of CAC and Verdugo

			- [DB quote](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/29/candidates-in-upcoming-usac-elections-participate-in-solidarity-encampment)- "Eli Tsives... criticized Verdugo’s use of her platform to promote messages he believes makes Jewish students uncomfortable on campus. “They (the Cultural Affairs Commission) have purposefully used their position and power to make us Jewish students feel unsafe,” he said."

	- CAC's social media presence

		- Instagram 

			- [Protest](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6M4IM1v3LI/?hl=en&img_index=4)

			- [Nakba Day](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7DHmdrvogE/?img_index=1)

			- [Block](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6sht0ROgJk/?hl=en)


### Beyond the protests

- (Go into the details of BIPAC here)

- In total, evidence that CAC has shown a pattern of 
			
	- Framing violent acts against Israelis as justified “resistance”

		- Al-Aqsa flood mentioned on Oct 7th anniversary 

	- Promoting unverified, negative claims about Israel 

		- X 
			- [July 25th](https://x.com/mxmsworld/status/1816579036560158872)

			- [Sometime after Nov 7th, 2023](https://x.com/itranslate123/status/1292459086257295360)

			- [Fuck Israel!](https://x.com/culturalaffairs/status/1845673414079693258)

		- reposts (Israel)

			- [Israel is a...](https://x.com/Fx1Jonny/status/1845435414628237758)

			- [Once Israel falls...](https://x.com/mxmsworld/status/1816579036560158872)

			- [The problem is not Netanyahu...](https://x.com/itranslate123/status/1292459086257295360)
	
- Perpetuates narratives that cast students as complicit in perceived injustices,

	- [UCLABIPAC](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2024/06/20/Why-do-major-protest-related-incidents-keep-happening-at-UCLA/)

		- "There is so much propaganda that those are quote-unquote Israelis, those are settlers."

			- "Exactly. By making Israeli = Settler and Settler = Zionist, the logic becomes transitive: Israeli = Zionist. This framing effectively removes any distinction between national identity and political ideology, equating simply being Israeli with adherence to a specific political stance (Zionism) and even further, with the idea of being a “settler.”"

			- This approach collapses nationality into ideology, treating anyone who is Israeli as inherently supportive of Zionist policies, regardless of their personal beliefs or political stance. It ignores the diversity of thought within Israel, where there is a wide spectrum of perspectives on issues like the occupation, settlements, and peace with Palestinians. It also misrepresents the reality of Jewish and Israeli identities, which can’t be neatly categorized by political ideology, as Zionism itself has multiple interpretations.

			- This view rejects the idea that someone can be Israeli without being a Zionist, meaning it dismisses the possibility of Israelis who might be critical of Zionist policies, supportive of Palestinian rights, or against the occupation. Essentially, it equates national identity with ideology, with no room for variation.

			- By conflating Israeli identity with Zionism and settler-colonialism, it labels all Israelis as participants in a colonial project, regardless of their individual beliefs, actions, or even ethnic background.

			- American = Settler = Deserving of harm at the hands of the original inhabitants of this land. Then by the same logic this individual also deserves to die. 

		- The parents are white comment

- They spread harmful misinformation, (e.g., accusations of atrocities without evidence),

	- [Atrocities of Oct 7th](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/10/what-we-know-about-three-widespread-israel-hamas-war-claims/)

	- [Bisan Owda](https://www.thewrap.com/bisan-owda-emmy-israel-gaza-idf-executions-claim/), unsubstantiated 

	- [Propaganda on the number of Palestinians killed](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA2Um1qR26B/?hl=en&img_index=2)

		- Versus Congressional Research Service, updated Oct 4th, "**Conflict, humanitarian situation, and international action.** In the conflict to date, more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry there. Additionally, about 90% of Gaza’s some 2.1 million residents have been displaced, with most facing unsanitary, overcrowded conditions alongside acute shortages of food, water, medical care, and other essential supplies and services. Obstacles to transporting aid through crossings and Israeli checkpoints and then safely delivering it have contributed to high levels of food insecurity. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) as of August 2024, humanitarian aid was probably preventing famine, but “hunger and malnutrition remain dire, and hunger-related mortality is likely still occurring.”"

- Disinformation (other)

	- [White people forgetting...](https://x.com/oodhamboi/status/1845526318445916559)

	- [This is the most staged shit...](https://x.com/jawn/status/1812257991045111925)


- Verdugo is compromised and unfit to work within USAC

	- All of the above represents a "conflict of interest," as defined by bylaws, with respect to any political position on Israel

### Does the issue with USAC go beyond Verdugo? 

- [Dec 18th](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1BN9tHr054/?hl=en) post by Hillel says they have been dismissed by student government and EDI

- They will not work with Hillel 

- They will not hear BIPAC calls for impeachment

- Regardless of what they "should" be doing, they messed up based on a technicality by engaging in "unlawful behavior", ie being an official part of the encampment and therefor complicit in blocking students from accessing areas of campus

- USAC is also compromised by the above 

	- USAC constitution II.B.3.a. 

		- rights of students to participate in all activities

		- rights of students to a fair hearing of grievances 

- There hasn't been a symbolic move made to address the uptick in antisemitism that's been happening *on campus* 

	- Case, case, case

	- The fact that they won't condemn antisemitic incidents occurring *during protests* is proof that there is a *conflict of interest* with respect to political positions on Israel, and the Palestine-Israel conflict

		- Their association with UC Divest in Resolutions in favor of BDS is a perfect example of this 

			- UC Divest featured the pig effigy in their own propaganda video (image)

- All of the above indicates their behavior is *exclusive*, USAC is *excluding* members of the campus community 

- Resolutions become more extreme

	- Their more recent [resolution](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/07/usac-passes-resolution-calling-for-ucla-chancellor-gene-blocks-resignation) possibly targets Israeli and Jewish culture rather than Israel's policies

		- [It](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19g5EXnKlBeZt3oCtgEqLHCfjg4fN7Gi4EqtPz_nlESs/mobilebasic) is questionably far reaching, and calls for the abolishment of the UCLA Nazarian Center

- Given Verdugo has been [*reelected*](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/17/bruins-elect-1st-international-student-as-usac-president-in-2024-elections) to office, USAC corruption is likely to continue (abuse of power)

- The position and other evidence against the state of Israel together with attack on a certain group of students at UCLA---by discrimination, exclusion and abuse of power---proves an attack on a particular group of students based on Israeli national origin or association with Israel 

	- The Israeli community (or the entire Jewish community inclusive of the Israeli community)  is too small a voting bloc, theoretically or practically to change USAC election outcomes (by "Article Draft", *USAC represents an abuse of power*)

		- [UCLA numbers for undergraduate and graduate students](https://www.ucla.edu/about/facts-and-figures) are most accurate

		- [Hillel at UCLA (numbers of Jewish students)](https://www.jewishfoundationla.org/grant-org/hillel-at-ucla/#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20center%20of,and%20empowers%20110%20student%20leaders)

			- [Hillel-dot-org estimate](https://www.hillel.org/college/university-of-california-los-angeles/)

		- [Daily Bruin gives election participation numbers](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/17/bruins-elect-1st-international-student-as-usac-president-in-2024-elections)


	- If by the claims made in the lawsuit, and the evidence above, USAC has shown consistent bias against a certain student group, then they are seeking to "institutionalize" this bias

		- refer to "Notes" document *The problem with student fees*

- By the above, students *should not pay* their student fees

	- [86.11 *Conditions for Support*](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710528/PACAOS-80) "Particular
	programs and activities of a Registered Campus Organization funded from compulsory
	campus-based student fees shall be open to participation by the entire campus
	community."
