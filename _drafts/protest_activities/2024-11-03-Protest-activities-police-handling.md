	- [Counter protesters](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785598823437668461) continue to fight pro-Palestinian demonstrators in full view of police about 500 ft away, they arrived 27 min ago and have not intervened. 2:13 am

	- [Exactly 1 hr](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785606841801879767) after arriving at UCLA, police move in closer and counter-protestors move away, leaving the encampment alone. 

	- [Police formed a line](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785609923088519168), "Police at UCLA have formed a line about a hundred feet from the encampment. Counter-protestors have left, there have been no visible arrests so far. I saw the brawl last 2.5 hours, police arrived 1 hour ago."

	- [Police directing people to exits](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785616767676743886), "UCLA: California Highway Patrol officer says "everybody" needs to go. Directs peoples onto the sidewalk to exit."

	- "I got here at about 12:20 am, they arrived at about 1:45 am and then kind of stood at a line maybe a few hundred feet away just watching for about an hour. And so the brawl went on for about 2 hours without any kind of police intervention. 

		Once the police decided to move in, the counter-protesters left, some of them were chanting "USA! USA!" And, you know, there was many people saying, you know, don't interfere with police let them do their job, or pro-police kind of things."

	- LAPD was called by several people prior to Karen Bass and UCLA Admin intervention 

	- "Two UCPD cars and one UCLA EMT showed up at 11:13 p.m. in an attempt to break up the conflict, but all left the scene at 11:21 p.m. UCPD Chief of Police John Thomas said to the Daily Bruin that the force only had around five to six officers on duty. Officers came under attack while trying to help an injured person, and so they left, Thomas said."

		"“We called several different agencies. Right now, they’re preparing to go in and render the location safe,” he said. “It has nothing to do with the encampment, but I do want to render the situation safe and take care of those that may have been injured at this point – to possibly make arrests if that opportunity presents.”"

	- "Law enforcement did not intervene until shortly after 2:40 a.m. despite Mary Osako, the vice chancellor for strategic communications, previously claiming in a written statement sent at 12:40 a.m. on Wednesday that the university had called law enforcement personnel for immediate support."

- [UCLA statement on attack at encampment](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-disturbances-at-encampment), emailed at 12:40 a.m.

	- "(May 1, 12:12 a.m.) Mary Osako, vice chancellor for UCLA Strategic Communications, said:

		“Horrific acts of violence occurred at the encampment tonight and we immediately called law enforcement for mutual aid support. The fire department and medical personnel are on the scene. We are sickened by this senseless violence and it must end.”"

	- "Former UCPD Chief John Thomas told the Daily Bruin that UCPD only had five or six officers on duty April 30 and May 1 and that the department called several different agencies for assistance. However, documents acquired by the Daily Bruin outlined that agencies were not required to respond to requests for assistance, only having to do so if they had sufficient spare resources."

		- What documents? Were they specific to this situation or policy docs? 

		- So they waited until Karen Bass stepped in? 

- [Newsom tweet](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1785589489878049091), 1:38 a.m. 

	- "Our office is closely monitoring the situation at @UCLA.

		Law enforcement leaders are in contact this evening and resources are being mobilized."

- [Karen Bass tweet](https://x.com/MayorOfLA/status/1785591832321151196), 1:47 a.m.

	- "The violence unfolding this evening at UCLA is absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable. 

		LAPD has arrived on campus."


### Immediate administrative response

- Office of Campus Safety

	- Braziel hired

	- "“On the Tuesday night of the attack, Thomas said he was home watching the Dodgers game when he was alerted to the problems by Beck. He said he immediately called the LAPD’s West L.A. station and asked the watch commander to deploy resources. Then he called UCLA’s watch commander and instructed him to call in mutual aid assistance from law enforcement with the cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica and sheriff’s deputies.”"

	- "Thomas said he arrived on campus shortly before midnight and found that 19 officers from UCLA, the LAPD and three of the mutual aid agencies had arrived but had not moved in to quell the violence. When he asked why, he said an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small. Thomas said he asked why they couldn’t go in with the forces they had, and the lieutenant told him he was directed to wait.

		It took more than 90 minutes for sufficient forces to arrive and intervene. Thomas said it usually takes an hour or even two to amass “mobile field forces” large enough — 50 officers or more from all over the city — to handle situations like the melee at UCLA."

	- This puts "sufficient forces" arrival time at approximately 1:30 a.m.
