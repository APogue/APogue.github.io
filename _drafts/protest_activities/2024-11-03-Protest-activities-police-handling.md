	- [Counter protesters](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785598823437668461) continue to fight pro-Palestinian demonstrators in full view of police about 500 ft away, they arrived 27 min ago and have not intervened. 2:13 am

	- [Exactly 1 hr](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785606841801879767) after arriving at UCLA, police move in closer and counter-protestors move away, leaving the encampment alone. 

	- [Police formed a line](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785609923088519168), "Police at UCLA have formed a line about a hundred feet from the encampment. Counter-protestors have left, there have been no visible arrests so far. I saw the brawl last 2.5 hours, police arrived 1 hour ago."

	- [Police directing people to exits](https://x.com/MrOlmos/status/1785616767676743886), "UCLA: California Highway Patrol officer says "everybody" needs to go. Directs peoples onto the sidewalk to exit."

	- "I got here at about 12:20 am, they arrived at about 1:45 am and then kind of stood at a line maybe a few hundred feet away just watching for about an hour. And so the brawl went on for about 2 hours without any kind of police intervention. 

		Once the police decided to move in, the counter-protesters left, some of them were chanting "USA! USA!" And, you know, there was many people saying, you know, don't interfere with police let them do their job, or pro-police kind of things."

	- LAPD was called by several people prior to Karen Bass and UCLA Admin intervention 

	- "Two UCPD cars and one UCLA EMT showed up at 11:13 p.m. in an attempt to break up the conflict, but all left the scene at 11:21 p.m. UCPD Chief of Police John Thomas said to the Daily Bruin that the force only had around five to six officers on duty. Officers came under attack while trying to help an injured person, and so they left, Thomas said."

		"“We called several different agencies. Right now, they’re preparing to go in and render the location safe,” he said. “It has nothing to do with the encampment, but I do want to render the situation safe and take care of those that may have been injured at this point – to possibly make arrests if that opportunity presents.”"

	- "Law enforcement did not intervene until shortly after 2:40 a.m. despite Mary Osako, the vice chancellor for strategic communications, previously claiming in a written statement sent at 12:40 a.m. on Wednesday that the university had called law enforcement personnel for immediate support."

- [UCLA statement on attack at encampment](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-disturbances-at-encampment), emailed at 12:40 a.m.

	- "(May 1, 12:12 a.m.) Mary Osako, vice chancellor for UCLA Strategic Communications, said:

		“Horrific acts of violence occurred at the encampment tonight and we immediately called law enforcement for mutual aid support. The fire department and medical personnel are on the scene. We are sickened by this senseless violence and it must end.”"

	- "Former UCPD Chief John Thomas told the Daily Bruin that UCPD only had five or six officers on duty April 30 and May 1 and that the department called several different agencies for assistance. However, documents acquired by the Daily Bruin outlined that agencies were not required to respond to requests for assistance, only having to do so if they had sufficient spare resources."

		- What documents? Were they specific to this situation or policy docs? 

		- So they waited until Karen Bass stepped in? 

- [Newsom tweet](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1785589489878049091), 1:38 a.m. 

	- "Our office is closely monitoring the situation at @UCLA.

		Law enforcement leaders are in contact this evening and resources are being mobilized."

- [Zach Seidl tweet](https://x.com/ZachSeidlLA/status/1785577683264385384), 1:51 a.m. 

	- "Statement regarding this evening’s incident at UCLA:

		“The Mayor has spoken to Chancellor Block and Chief Choi. LAPD is responding immediately to Chancellor Block’s request for support on campus.”"

- [Karen Bass tweet](https://x.com/MayorOfLA/status/1785591832321151196), 1:47 a.m.

	- "The violence unfolding this evening at UCLA is absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable. 

		LAPD has arrived on campus."


### Immediate administrative response

- Office of Campus Safety

	- Braziel hired 

- [UCLA’s top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-03/before-mob-attack-ucla-police-chief-was-ordered-to-create-security-plan-but-didnt-sources-say), May 3rd

	- "“On the Tuesday night of the attack, Thomas said he was home watching the Dodgers game when he was alerted to the problems by Beck. He said he immediately called the LAPD’s West L.A. station and asked the watch commander to deploy resources. Then he called UCLA’s watch commander and instructed him to call in mutual aid assistance from law enforcement with the cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica and sheriff’s deputies.”"

	- "Thomas said he arrived on campus shortly before midnight and found that 19 officers from UCLA, the LAPD and three of the mutual aid agencies had arrived but had not moved in to quell the violence. When he asked why, he said an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small. Thomas said he asked why they couldn’t go in with the forces they had, and the lieutenant told him he was directed to wait.

		It took more than 90 minutes for sufficient forces to arrive and intervene. Thomas said it usually takes an hour or even two to amass “mobile field forces” large enough — 50 officers or more from all over the city — to handle situations like the melee at UCLA."

	- This puts "sufficient forces" arrival time at approximately 1:30 a.m. 


### Notes (don't delete these ones)

- UCLA is engaging in wasteful spending using police and security forces to formulate a robust rather than targeted response to violent counter-protesters 

- Ultimately the chief of police was blamed here

	- The impending or possible danger wasn't made clear to the chief of police by the administration, we know this because it wasn't made clear to the students. 

	- If administrative moves were truly being made for riot preparedness, why wasn't there any transparency with respect to this process? In real time? 

	- The reason the chief said "general response", is because *he didn't know* how out of hand things were going to get and he was not made aware that this was a possibility.

	- If it were the case that he needed to come up with a strategic plan for several scenarios, he clearly did not have the training to do so (nor was there redundancy in the event of failure either by a single individual or an interdepartmental logjam).

	- Evidence shows huge police responses at Regents meetings, etc. A last minute call for a task no one could have been prepared for without prior training or protocol was an exercise in passing the buck when the state of campus safety was completely unknown. 

- Based on their inability to address the elephant in the room at UCLA presently, treating students as an outlandish, violent mob, shows they would never have been ready for the April 30th riots. Because the UCLA students are not an outlandish, violent mob. So neither Thomas or anyone else would assume that an army would be necessary to control them. And neither Thomas or anyone else should be expected to prepare an army for a phantom militia---

- What they wanted Thomas to address was an elephant in the room. His failure to pick up what they were implying and direct resources at it is now what is being called "a failure" on his part. 

- When January 6th occurred at our nation's capital did we blame Capitol Police? Did we blame [Nancy Pelosi](https://cha.house.gov/2024/8/new-obtained-hbo-footage-shows-pelosi-again-taking-responsibility-for-capitol-security-on-january-6) for not beefing up security beyond that of any other congressional count and certification? No, Trump incited a violent mob to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. That mob was thereafter held accountable, not Congress. Even if Congress has members some would consider despicable, that is irrelevant. That mob was years in the making. The result of systemic issues that run deep in the various factions that make up this country. 

- What the police did do on June 10th, is serve as a deterrent for counter-protesters. A few showed up, but nothing came of it. But there is no telling whether June 10th could have ended like April 30th (or the days before) had the police not been there. 

	Will they be mobilizing these forces preemptively every time? Spending this money every time? Directing the forces at students and creating collateral damage every time? The collateral damage is exactly that, collateral damage that UCLA is dragging out for the public to view as justice served. 

- The non-affiliates need to be addressed, explicitly. 

- The barricades that continually go up, even for small encampments, are likely meant for agitators and counter-protesters, not police or students. Or is it to keep "Zionists" out? Or are the Zionists counter-protesters? While actions in April were broader than a move simply for the sake of safety, if the students have to protect themselves from bodily harm either way, then any attempt to protest without the barricades and exclusion, as many students may be willing to do, would put their safety at risk. Because no one will address the safety to students as its own separate issue, these broad, umbrella policies meant to keep the peace are really serving to chill free speech activities on campus. 

	The reason UCLA decided to allow the encampment in the first place was because they wanted to be part of the national conversation. They wanted the spotlight partially on them. As policing and policy continue to be layered on, without addressing the real issues, UCLA will never again be part of this conversation, or potentially any other. Meanwhile Columbia shut their campus down to non-affiliates in a move that directly addresses an issue causing chaos and unsafe conditions on campus. That acknowledgement, in whatever form appropriate for UCLA, is vitally important. 

- One possible scenario: Sunday and Monday tensions mounted, they decided *on Tuesday* to clear the encampment, thereby giving Thomas no prior notification, and relied on his "general response" forces in the event anything went wrong

- They did not say *if you stay it could be unsafe*

	- They were relying on Thomas despite having no confirmed game plan 

	- They didn't want to demonize the counter-protesters, and were willing to risk the safety of the students 

	- They didn't want to admit that they miscalculated and were miscalculating the state of campus safety


### play by play 

- Delayed police response

	- CSC and UCPD present on the scene did little to quell violence [article](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/01/pro-israel-counter-protesters-attempt-to-storm-encampment-sparking-violence)

		- CSC called LAPD sometime before 10:55 p.m. "when the first firework was released"

		- CSC Security: Hired by UCLA, retreated into Kaplan Hall and did not engage with the protesters or counter-protesters

		- Two UCPD cars and one UCLA EMT arrived at 11:13 p.m. but left by 11:21 p.m.

		- UCPD Chief John Thomas mentioned only five to six officers on duty and that officers retreated after coming under attack

		- Around 70 police officers were on the scene by 3 a.m.
