Thesis: What is UC and UCLA philosophy? (insert the quote about even the smallest thing mattering from the 2024 toolkit)

Thesis1: The philosophy of the school is handling that is **content-neutral**

Thesis2: The philosophy of the schools is the support of **academic freedom**

Thesis3: The philosophy of the school is **freedom of speech**

Thesis4: Free speech is not an unconditional constitutional right

Thesis5: Free speech activities are subject to **time, place, and manner restrictions**

Thesis6: Free speech activities will be **forcibly disrupted** if they interfere with university operations 


### Administrative position on free speech activities 

- Free speech and academic freedom 

	- "Under the First Amendment, universities—especially public ones like UCLA—must allow a broad range of political speech, including statements that may be deeply offensive or critical of certain groups or governments. The Supreme Court has historically protected even controversial or extreme speech, provided it doesn’t incite imminent violence or constitute a direct threat."
	
	- Qualification of knowledge for the sake of orthodoxy, conformity or propriety is a societal construct. Truth is absolute.

	- This means it may be shocking, it may come with hate, and on our quest to protect it, it may not be present at all.

	- Especially important with regard to unfettered, free exchange of ideas between any two entities---the lifeblood of human evolution

	- Content neutrality, two-way street 

- In contention with 

	- 1st Amendment exceptions narrowly defined

		- True threats (give an example)

		- Defamation (give an example)

	- 14th Amendment rights (getting too heady, USAC stuff in this doc?)

		- Anti-discrimination policy

			- Harassment 

			- Severe and/or pervasive, must interfere with access to education 

		- Title VI 

			- Totality of circumstances

			- Rhetoric motivated by bias

	- Time, place, and manner

		- Content-neutral, what is applied to one must be applied to all

- UC/UCLA put into place distancing measures to protect it from liability

	- Positions on issues taken by student governments are not positions taken by the university (by PACAOS-63.00)

		- this can be grouped with USAC

	- Campus organizations must avoid unauthorized implication that it is sponsored or endorsed by the university (by PACAOS-70.70)

	- UC regents passed article J2

	- DB---stated that they do not moderate messaging of any UCLA org

	- DEI doc---Supreme Court defined extremely narrow exceptions for free speech
