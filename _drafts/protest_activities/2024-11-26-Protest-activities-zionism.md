Across all topics, begin with a real-life scenario, then discuss it with research 

### Encampment exclusions were based on "ideology"

- Evidence shows that "Zionist" was the basis for exclusion by encampment members (what do I do with Eli Tsives)

- [‘Are you a Zionist?’ Checkpoints at UCLA encampment provoked fear, debate among Jews](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-09/are-you-a-zionist-checkpoints-at-ucla-encampment-provoked-debate-among-jewish-students)

	- [Here’s another one from @ucla. Protestors took over access to area near school library:](https://x.com/iambrianbj/status/1785215261529850007?s=61)

		- "“So you won’t let me in because I’m Jewish?” 
		“Ummm no…  we have a couple Jewish students here … are you a Zionist?”
		“Yes of course I am”
		“Well yeah, we’re not gonna  let Zionists in.”"

### Background 

- [Capital ‘Z’ versus lower-case ‘z’ zionism](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/capital-z-versus-lower-case-z-zionism/)

- [Panel opens discussion on Jewish community issues](https://dailybruin.com/2014/01/13/panel-opens-discussion-on-jewish-community-issues)

	- "Zionists advocate for Jewish sovereignty in the region contested by Israelis and Palestinians, while anti-Zionists oppose this viewpoint." Definition is always changing.

### Beyond UCLA, defining antisemitism has been a subject of debate

- [ACLU weighs in](https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-urges-congress-to-oppose-anti-semitism-awareness-act) 

	- (Not passed the senate, [H.R. 6090](https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr6090/BILLS-118hr6090eh.pdf), [criticized](https://raskin.house.gov/2024/5/rep-raskin-statement-on-h-r-6090) for being symbolic, too vague)

	- The question of Israel's statehood is "political" and protected
	
- How this relates to "Zionist," to say "anti-Zionism" is antisemitic is overbroad

- [ADL definition anti-Zionism](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/anti-zionism?gad_source=1&gclsrc=aw.ds) 

### Hillel

- Hillel's take on anti-Israeli positions 

- [Hillel Israel Guidelines](https://www.hillel.org/israel-guidelines/#:~:text=Hillel%20views%20Israel%20as%20a,to%20Jewish%20identification%20for%20students)

- [Hillel chapter at Swarthmore votes to change its name](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/18/swarthmore-hillel-breaks-parent-organization-over-israel-issues)

- [Swarthmore Hillel votes to disaffiliate with Hillel Int’l](https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/swarthmore-hillel-votes-to-disaffiliate-with-hillel-intl/)


### The pro-Palestinian movement is vague about its definition

- Define the political position of Hamas

	- The state of Israel is a "Zionist Project"

	- [Propaganda document](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PDF.pdf)

	- [General Principles and Policies](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/hamas-2017.pdf)

	- [Core Policies](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/doctrine-hamas)

		- Position 18

		- Position 20

- SJP

	- [Mission](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/90)

	- [Letter](https://www.instagram.com/p/CygsqBTPKsQ/?hl=en&img_index=1) to the regents 

	- [Al-Aqsa Flood](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17bwsih/when_did_it_become_acceptable_to_openly/)

		- (this is also located in "protest activities-violence")


- JVP 

	- JVP is interesting because they are mysterious in a way. In a way that only talking with them directly will solve. Building that mystery into the story may make it more compelling. 

	- [Mission](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/3992)

		- How do they define "Zionism?"

		- They do not interact with CAC

		- They do not partake in any discrimination or hate speech

		- But when those who do use them as "evidence" to defend against accusations of antisemitism, they don't get involved

		- They are true peacekeepers, freedom fighters, they are the definition of "collective strength," they function for the cause only

### Protesting student ideological demographics

- Students felt they didn't have an "American viewpoint" when it came to the pro-Palestinian protests

- How many were "centrist"

- How many were extreme? 


### Exclusion faced confusion and backlash

- Exclusion from areas of campus faced enormous confusion and backlash

- [Powell Library Wristband Policy During Ecampment: True or False](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1cnol2u/powell_library_wristband_policy_during_ecampment/)

- [it’s affecting students now](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ch82s8/its_affecting_students_now/)

	- disabled students

	- students completely confused by exclusion tactics, began using identity to prove or disprove assumed motives

- [UCLA ordered by judge to craft plan in support of Jewish students](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1efhxn3/ucla_ordered_by_judge_to_craft_plan_in_support_of/)

### Where does JVP stand?

- National JVP has been clear (I believe)

- UCLA JVP has been unclear

### Zionism's ties with cultural identity 

- Student and faculty positions are often identity-driven

	- Find the 3rd lawsuit

### True disruptions to campus operations 

- Encampment blockading 

	- Reddit---people can't get to class, their jobs, disabled people are denied access to campus

- The marching through the halls with chants of "From the River to the Sea" (TikTok)

	- [Pro-Palestinian protesters took over UCLA's Dodd Hall](https://www.tiktok.com/@journalistjeremy/video/7372692453956062507)

- The screen that UCLA permitted to stay without permit 

	- Reddit quote

	- [Hillel comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HqCOvk9-i0iW2xlYqvjQGyzjWDmIzjn/view), "There is a screen placed by community members at UCLA playing the horrors of October 7th on repeat--and we
	can’t learn over the constant noise of Jews being slaughtered. The wider community is prioritizing their own idea of
	activism over what Jewish students want. We want peace and a diplomatic resolution."

### The administrative role

- Without positional guidance (UCLA as a voice itself)

	- Campus culture becomes extremely polarized

- UCLA weak follow ups on incidents or no interaction with orgs at all 

	- Student orgs resigned to handle matters themselves

	- grievances posted to social media or Daily Bruin were not acknowledged 

- Without any support or condemnation with respect to organizational rhetoric, a vacuum is created

	- Created an extremely polarized campus environment 

		- More division between students

		- More animosity between students and non-affiliates

		- The student body were forced to pick a side
