Across all topics, begin with a real-life scenario, then discuss it with research 

### Encampment exclusions were based on "ideology"

- Evidence shows that "Zionist" was the basis for exclusion by encampment members (what do I do with Eli Tsives)

- [‘Are you a Zionist?’ Checkpoints at UCLA encampment provoked fear, debate among Jews](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-09/are-you-a-zionist-checkpoints-at-ucla-encampment-provoked-debate-among-jewish-students)

	- [Here’s another one from @ucla. Protestors took over access to area near school library:](https://x.com/iambrianbj/status/1785215261529850007?s=61)

		- "“So you won’t let me in because I’m Jewish?” 
		“Ummm no…  we have a couple Jewish students here … are you a Zionist?”
		“Yes of course I am”
		“Well yeah, we’re not gonna  let Zionists in.”"

### Discrimination was occurring at the encampment

- Discrimination 

	- Student testimonials

		- [Lavie Levi](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment)

	- Symbology 

		- Red triangles were there for two days and were removed without condemnation 

	- Blockading students 

		- Student barred entry because he is a ["Zionist"](https://x.com/iambrianbj/status/1785215261529850007?s=61)

		- [Frankel v. Regents of the University of California](https://becketnewsite.s3.amazonaws.com/20240605222051/Complaint-in-Frankel-v.-Regents-of-UCLA.pdf)


### Background 

- [Capital ‘Z’ versus lower-case ‘z’ zionism](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/capital-z-versus-lower-case-z-zionism/)

- [Panel opens discussion on Jewish community issues](https://dailybruin.com/2014/01/13/panel-opens-discussion-on-jewish-community-issues)

	- "Zionists advocate for Jewish sovereignty in the region contested by Israelis and Palestinians, while anti-Zionists oppose this viewpoint." Definition is always changing.

### Beyond UCLA, defining antisemitism has been a subject of debate

- [ACLU weighs in](https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-urges-congress-to-oppose-anti-semitism-awareness-act) 

	- (Not passed the senate, [H.R. 6090](https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr6090/BILLS-118hr6090eh.pdf), [criticized](https://raskin.house.gov/2024/5/rep-raskin-statement-on-h-r-6090) for being symbolic, too vague)

	- The question of Israel's statehood is "political" and protected
	
- How this relates to "Zionist," to say "anti-Zionism" is antisemitic is overbroad

- [ADL definition anti-Zionism](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/anti-zionism?gad_source=1&gclsrc=aw.ds) 

### Hillel

- Hillel's take on anti-Israeli positions 

- [Hillel Israel Guidelines](https://www.hillel.org/israel-guidelines/#:~:text=Hillel%20views%20Israel%20as%20a,to%20Jewish%20identification%20for%20students)

- [Hillel chapter at Swarthmore votes to change its name](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/18/swarthmore-hillel-breaks-parent-organization-over-israel-issues)

- [Swarthmore Hillel votes to disaffiliate with Hillel Int’l](https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/swarthmore-hillel-votes-to-disaffiliate-with-hillel-intl/)


### The pro-Palestinian movement is vague about its definition

- Define the political position of Hamas

	- The state of Israel is a "Zionist Project"

	- [Propaganda document](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PDF.pdf)

	- [General Principles and Policies](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/hamas-2017.pdf)

	- [Core Policies](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/doctrine-hamas)

		- Position 18

		- Position 20

- SJP

	- [Mission](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/90)

	- [Letter](https://www.instagram.com/p/CygsqBTPKsQ/?hl=en&img_index=1) to the regents 

	- [Al-Aqsa Flood](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17bwsih/when_did_it_become_acceptable_to_openly/)

		- (this is also located in "protest activities-violence")


- JVP 

	- National JVP has a position, and from there it's possible that positions range depending on individual orgs. Michigan JVP for example, takes a very extreme position. 

	- JVP is interesting because they are mysterious in a way that only talking with them directly will solve. Building that mystery into the story may make it more compelling. 

	- [Mission](https://community.ucla.edu/studentorg/3992)

		- How do they define "Zionism?"

		- They do not interact with CAC (this is in the USAC doc)

		- They do not partake in any discrimination or hate speech

		- But when those who do use them as "evidence" to defend against accusations of antisemitism, they don't get involved

		- They are true peacekeepers, freedom fighters, they are the definition of "collective strength," they function for the cause only 

	- [Reaction](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyZwV-dO3Ue/?img_index=1) to Oct 7th 


### USAC needs to define it 

- [USAC Resolution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6508fc8793db9d26ceab8952/t/663f458d5f90ea7b2468c313/1715422605926/resolution.2024-02-20.A+Resolution+to+Boycott+and+Divest+from+Apartheid,+Ethnic+Cleansing,+and+Genocide.pdf)

	- "UCLA administrators have refused to condemn Zionist settler colonialism,
	genocide, and apartheid; have refused to acknowledge our own complicity in settler-colonial
	genocide and apartheid through UC contracts, pensions, and investments in companies
	profiting from Israeli violations of international law; and have refused to condemn the US’s
	arming and funding of Israel’s genocide of Palestinians;"

	- Given CAC rhetoric, etc, what is "Zionist settler colonialism?"

### Protesting student ideological demographics

- Students felt they didn't have an "American viewpoint" when it came to the pro-Palestinian protests

- How many were "centrist"

- How many were extreme? 


### Exclusion faced confusion and backlash

- Exclusion from areas of campus faced enormous confusion and backlash

- [Powell Library Wristband Policy During Ecampment: True or False](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1cnol2u/powell_library_wristband_policy_during_ecampment/)

- [it’s affecting students now](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ch82s8/its_affecting_students_now/)

	- disabled students

	- students completely confused by exclusion tactics, began using identity to prove or disprove assumed motives

- [UCLA ordered by judge to craft plan in support of Jewish students](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1efhxn3/ucla_ordered_by_judge_to_craft_plan_in_support_of/)

### Where does JVP stand?

- National JVP has been clear (I believe)

- UCLA JVP has been unclear

### Zionism's ties with cultural identity 

- Student and faculty positions are often identity-driven

	- Find the 3rd lawsuit


### The administrative role

- Without positional guidance (UCLA as a voice itself)

	- Campus culture becomes extremely polarized

- UCLA weak follow ups on incidents or no interaction with orgs at all 

	- Student orgs resigned to handle matters themselves

	- grievances posted to social media or Daily Bruin were not acknowledged 

- Without any support or condemnation with respect to organizational rhetoric, a vacuum is created

	- Created an extremely polarized campus environment 

		- More division between students

		- More animosity between students and non-affiliates

		- The student body were forced to pick a side
