### Background 

- [Capital ‘Z’ versus lower-case ‘z’ zionism](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/capital-z-versus-lower-case-z-zionism/)

- [Panel opens discussion on Jewish community issues](https://dailybruin.com/2014/01/13/panel-opens-discussion-on-jewish-community-issues)

	- "Zionists advocate for Jewish sovereignty in the region contested by Israelis and Palestinians, while anti-Zionists oppose this viewpoint." Definition is always changing.

### Hillel

- What is the Hillel definition of Zionist?

- [Hillel Israel Guidelines](https://www.hillel.org/israel-guidelines/#:~:text=Hillel%20views%20Israel%20as%20a,to%20Jewish%20identification%20for%20students)

- [Hillel chapter at Swarthmore votes to change its name](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/18/swarthmore-hillel-breaks-parent-organization-over-israel-issues)

- [Swarthmore Hillel votes to disaffiliate with Hillel Int’l](https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/swarthmore-hillel-votes-to-disaffiliate-with-hillel-intl/)

### The pro-Palestinian movement is vague about its definition




### Encampment exclusions were based on "ideology"

- There is evidence that "Zionist" was the basis for exclusion from areas of campus

- [‘Are you a Zionist?’ Checkpoints at UCLA encampment provoked fear, debate among Jews](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-09/are-you-a-zionist-checkpoints-at-ucla-encampment-provoked-debate-among-jewish-students)

- Reddit

	- https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1cnol2u/powell_library_wristband_policy_during_ecampment/

- JVP

- Hamas doctrine and evidence of anti-Israeli rhetoric 

- Students felt they didn't have an "American viewpoint" when it came to the pro-Palestinian protests

- Without any support or condemnation with respect to organizational rhetoric, a vacuum is created

- SJP was the "authority" on encampment conduct leading to civil rights infringements of Jewish students

- Created an extremely polarized protest environment 

	- Created more division between students

	- Created more animosity between students and non-affiliates

	- The general UCLA student body may become indoctrinated by chants, symbolism, and extreme rhetoric 


### Exclusion faced confusion and backlash

- Exclusion from areas of campus faced enormous confusion and backlash

	- https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ch82s8/its_affecting_students_now/

	- disabled students

	- students completely confused by exclusion tactics, began using identity to prove or disprove assumed motives

- Student and faculty positions are often identity-driven

- Without positional guidance (UCLA as a voice itself)

	- Campus culture becomes extremely polarized

- UCLA weak follow ups on incidents or no interaction with orgs at all 

	- Student orgs resigned to handle matters themselves

- What involvement they do have, the rhetoric lacked "balance"

	- Polarizes campus culture

- "Reporting" of grievances with administration posted to social media or Daily Bruin without any follow up or acknowledgment 

Bottom line: There is a difference between eliminating voices (which would go against higher learning philosophy and constitutional freedoms), and adding to the conversation, UCLA should understand the difference 


### Zionism's ties with cultural identity 




### True disruptions to campus operations 

- Encampment blockading 

	- Reddit---people can't get to class, their jobs, disabled people are denied access to campus

- The marching through the halls with chants of "From the River to the Sea" (TikTok)

	- [Pro-Palestinian protesters took over UCLA's Dodd Hall](https://www.tiktok.com/@journalistjeremy/video/7372692453956062507)

- The screen that UCLA permitted to stay without permit 

	- Reddit quote

	- [Hillel comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HqCOvk9-i0iW2xlYqvjQGyzjWDmIzjn/view), "There is a screen placed by community members at UCLA playing the horrors of October 7th on repeat--and we
	can’t learn over the constant noise of Jews being slaughtered. The wider community is prioritizing their own idea of
	activism over what Jewish students want. We want peace and a diplomatic resolution."
