Thesis: Safety through accountability

Thesis1: It becomes more clear that a pattern of bias existed during the major protest (which was garnering media attention) when the administration began releasing statements acknowledging problems, but deliberately avoided condemnation or promises to take action against alleged perpetrators of harassment and violence. 

Thesis2: "Violence" had been occurring all along, but it was the failure by the administration to adequately respond that drew larger and larger crowds to the encampment night after night. 

Thesis3: This failure to identify and address this pattern of behavior by the administration also left the UCPD Chief without the proper intel to adequately plan or be adequately prepared. 

Thesis4: On April 30th, when things got completely out of hand, even after police arrived they did nothing. 

Thesis5: Thomas took all the blame

Thesis6: But UCPD by policy functions as "operational execution" as opposed to "strategic direction" which is controlled by school administrators (Wade statement)

### Administrative messaging 

- [Friday 4/26– Mary Osako](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-about-encampment-on-campus-april-26), Vice Chacellor for Strategic Communications wrote---

	 “It’s also important to note that we are following University of California systemwide policy guidance, which directs us not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community.”

- [Mary Osako Sunday 4/28](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-28)- 

	- 11:22 a.m.---"“This morning, a group of demonstrators breached a barrier that the university had established separating two groups of protestors on our campus, resulting in physical altercations. UCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken about the violence that broke out.”"

	- 4:19 p.m.---“UCLA has a long history of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken to report that today, some physical altercations broke out among demonstrators on Royce Quad.

		“We have since instituted additional security measures and increased the numbers of our safety team members on site."

		“As an institution of higher education, we stand firmly for the idea that even when we disagree, we must still engage respectfully and recognize one another’s humanity. We are dismayed that certain individuals instead chose to jeopardize the physical safety of the community.”

- [Mary Osako Tuesday 4/30 11:48 a.m.](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/ucla-statement-on-demonstrations-april-30)

	 "“Yesterday some physical altercations occurred among demonstrators in Royce Quad. In response, we have taken several actions to significantly increase our security presence, including adding greater numbers of campus law enforcement, safety personnel and student affairs monitors. 


	“There was also a report of a student’s access to class being blocked by demonstrators yesterday. This kind of disruption to our teaching and learning mission is abhorrent, plain and simple. As such, we’ve taken several, immediate actions: Our student conduct process has been initiated, and could lead to severe disciplinary action including expulsion or suspension. The barriers that demonstrators used to block this student’s access to class have been removed and we have staff located around Royce Quad to help ensure that they will not go up again. We have also engaged law enforcement to investigate.


	“While the demonstration remains largely peaceful, our campus must remain a place where we treat one another with respect and recognize our shared humanity — not a place where we devolve into violence and bullying.” "

- [Gene Block Tuesday 4/30 5:04 p.m.](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/affirming-our-values-in-a-challenging-time)

	"Many of the demonstrators, as well as counter-demonstrators who have come to the area, have been peaceful in their activism. But the tactics of others have frankly been shocking and shameful. We have seen instances of violence completely at odds with our values as an institution dedicated to respect and mutual understanding. In other cases, students on their way to class have been physically blocked from accessing parts of the campus.


	UCLA supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid. These incidents have put many on our campus, especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear.


	In response, we’ve taken several immediate actions. We have significantly increased our security presence in the area, including adding greater numbers of law enforcement officers, safety personnel and student affairs mitigators. We have also engaged law enforcement to investigate the recent acts of violence. 


	The barriers that demonstrators used to block access to buildings have been removed, and we have staff located around Royce Quad to help ensure that they will not go up again. With regard to these incidents, our student conduct process has been initiated, and could lead to disciplinary action including suspension or expulsion."

	- **The administration did not understand or convey the urgency of the matter---this is the main point, the safety issue is why the encampment needed to be cleared right away**

- [April 30th Message for Those in UCLA Encampment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dmqAjbGiet8_PGS5cG632mjvPVt3geq5/view)

	"The established encampment is unlawful and violates university policy.

	For non-UCLA affiliates: Please be aware that your presence on campus as a non-affiliate engaged in an encampment violates the law and constitutes criminal behavior subject to misdemeanor charges."

	"Law enforcement is on hand to protect and keep safe demonstrators, counter-demonstrators, students, faculty, staff, non-affiliates and everyone in the campus and off-campus community. Law enforcement is prepared to arrest individuals, in accordance with applicable law.

	Non-UCLA persons are notified to leave the encampment and depart the campus immediately."

	"Students, staff and faculty who have joined the encampment should identify themselves, if requested...We are asking students, staff and faculty to leave the area. Those who choose to remain---including both students and employees---could face sanctions...[that] could lead to dismissal."

		- "According to emails between UC police departments obtained by the Daily Bruin, UCLA requested additional aid from the police departments of various UC campuses, but UCPD Lieutenant Issac Koh then canceled the request at 11:25 a.m. April 26."

		- "“We are CANCELING our SRT call out /MUTUAL AID at this time. The campus is not ready to move to a police operation as of yet, and we don’t foresee any action happening that will require us at least this coming weekend,” Koh said in the email. “We may be talking to you in the coming weeks regarding mutual aid if our campus administration moves to clearing this out.”"

He is currently the head of the team tasked with improving campus climate. He would be objective. 

		- "On Sunday..." He goes into specifics on this day and on the following Tuesday riot. 

		- "Not only must we recognize one another’s humanity, we must also learn to engage respectfully. In line with this, UCLA is substantially expanding its Dialogue across Difference (DaD) initiative, which will now move under the banner of UCLA’s Bedari Kindness Institute. Sady and Ludwig Kahn Professor of Jewish History David Myers, who leads the DaD initiative, has been named director of the institute."

- [Monday 4/29](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/30/ucpd-responds-to-counter-protesters-midnight-attempt-to-breach-encampment)

	“Around 60 counter-protesters attempted to breach the entrance of the encampment in Dickson Plaza around midnight Tuesday morning, drawing the presence of six UCPD officers in riot gear.”

	"A fight between members of both sides broke out around 11:40 p.m., leading the six UCPD officers to separate counter-protesters and participants of the encampment. Protesters inside the encampment brought wooden planks to the Powell scaffolding to block the entrance. CSC security officers then used their bikes to create a barrier between UCPD, counter-protesters and those inside the encampment."

### Thomas interview

- [UCLA’s top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-03/before-mob-attack-ucla-police-chief-was-ordered-to-create-security-plan-but-didnt-sources-say)

	- The article begins with, "The account of Thomas’ actions leading up to the attack was provided by three sources who were not authorized to speak publicly." Then Thomas gives his rebuttal. 

	- "Days earlier, campus leadership had directed Thomas to create a safety plan that would protect the UCLA community after the encampment was put up last week and began drawing agitators, the sources said. **The chief was told to spare no expense to bring in other UC police officers, offer overtime and hire as many private security officers needed to keep the peace.**"

	- “But university leadership, he said, decided to allow the tents “as an expression of students’ 1st Amendment rights” and directed that police not be included in any security plan. Under UC’s systemwide community safety plan, police are deployed as a last resort — guidance developed after UC Davis police pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters in 2011, setting off a firestorm of controversy and an internal review that changed campus practices.”

		“As a result, Thomas said he developed a plan that relied on private security and made sure to alert the Los Angeles Police Department of the need to respond immediately should problems arise. The private security guards, who were not authorized to make arrests, were instructed to contact UCLA police if needed.”

		“However, sources said he was directed to provide a written safety strategy outlining the response and preparation for various scenarios, such as a rally, skirmishes or violence — with the direction to do what was needed to keep the community safe — and he failed to deliver.”

	- "“He acknowledged that he did tell leadership that it would take just minutes to deploy police forces, but he was referring to a **general response** — not a force large enough to handle the size of the crowds that clashed that night. But three sources confirmed he was directly asked how long it would take for outside law enforcement to quell any violence.”"

	- "“As altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. **He could not recall exactly when that occurred**, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to secure their assistance.”

		“But he said the LAPD told him there was a problem with the payment system between the city and state, so the arrangements “couldn’t be done by the time of the attack.””

		- Based on the Newsroom updates, looks like this would have been April 30th

	- Thomas talks about mutual aid

		- “The mutual aid requests made Thursday and Friday, April 25-26 — which would have provided UCLA with more officers as they dealt with the camp and a dueling area erected by pro-Israel activists — were both canceled. Thomas said he made the requests because the university was tentatively planning to take down the encampment then, but he canceled them when that plan was delayed.”

			“He said he did not make any additional request after that because there was no specific reason for it at the time, but he directed his watch commander to do so immediately after learning about the attack, which he said was a “spontaneous” event. Critics are asking why he did not make another request sooner than that, after specific instances of physical altercations on Sunday and Monday.”




### Post-protest finger pointing 

- [UCLA police chief reassigned after security failures over pro-Palestinian protests](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-22/ucla-police-chief-reassigned-after-security-failures-over-pro-palestinian-protests), May 22nd

	- ““Given Chief Thomas’ mishandling of keeping our community safe and ear-splitting calls for him to step aside, this had to happen,” said one source, who was not authorized to speak publicly.”

	- “Several top LAPD leaders told The Times that Thomas had tarnished the reputation of Los Angeles law enforcement with what they called his lack of planning and poor communication with other agencies. They said they had to scramble for officers and wait until enough could be assembled to safely intervene at about 1:40 a.m.”

		- There was no dispersal order given at 1:40 a.m., there was no action until approximately 2:40 a.m. 

	- “But one UC source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Thomas and other officers should have moved in to stop the violence with the forces they had. In the case of active shooter situations, the source said, police used to wait for a larger force with sharpshooting expertise to assemble, but now move in more quickly to save those in danger. A similar protocol should have been used to quell the mob attack.”

		““Whoever gets there first has to go in,” the UC source said. “If you’re waiting while people are getting hit in the head, there is something wrong with the system. This was not a simple protest. It was a riot.””

		- The above is especially true because UCPD and LAPD are armed with less-than-lethal munitions, they should have made the dispersal order and started utilizing these munitions right away, the same way they did with the encampment days later. Who determines what protocol is used *after* police arrive? 

		- Are the munitions they buy only meant for one kind of assailant? 

	- “Wade Stern, president of the Federated University Peace Officers Assn., in a statement.”

		““What unfolded at UCLA calls into question whether UCLA complied with the guidelines to have in place senior administrators trained in crowd control response, with written plans for response that were the product of scenario training and consultation with its police department and outside law enforcement agencies,” said Stern, who is also an officer at UC Riverside. “The response to protests appears ad hoc and devoid of the structured planning mandated by the UC system.””
