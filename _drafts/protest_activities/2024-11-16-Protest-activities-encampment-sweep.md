- DB points to police mishandling [article](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/14/how-law-enforcement-mishandled-encampment-sweep-at-ucla-according-to-experts), updated May 14 at 11:41 p.m.

	- "Law enforcement agencies, led by UCPD and including LAPD, swept the encampment early in the morning of May 2, arresting more than 200 students. Officers used flash bangs, rubber bullets, batons and tear gas on protesters to breach the encampment."

	- "Michael Sierra-Arévalo, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, said **UCLA’s administration and UCPD should have worked harder to deescalate the situation and communicate with the encampment’s organizers before using force.** Research in crowd psychology and police response shows that negotiation is the best approach to handling protests, added Sierra-Arévalo, author of the book “The Danger Imperative: Violence, Death, and the Soul of Policing.”

		Because police officers receive minimal training on how to address protests, they often resort to what they are trained in the most, which is the threat and use of violence, Sierra-Arévalo said. However, the amount of force used at UCLA was a stark escalation from how police departments on university campuses normally act in response to peaceful protests, he added.

		“You don’t preemptively escalate to full riot gear, helmets, shields, shin guards, pepper spray,” Sierra-Arévalo said. “That is actually creating a circumstance that is much more likely to result in violent conflict and is not conducive to avoiding the escalation of protest.”"

	- "Some experts alleged that certain police actions at UCLA violated state law. Carol Sobel, a civil rights attorney, said the police’s use of **excessive force on peaceful protesters violated Assembly Bill 48,** which states that law enforcement agencies in California can only use less-than-lethal ammunition if someone violently resists arrest or presents an immediate threat of serious harm."

	- "“It’s less likely to be lethal, but it’s not non-lethal,” Sierra-Arévalo said. “What’s not clear to me is that what was happening on the UCLA campus or on other campuses was anywhere near the level of physical resistance that I, as an expert in policing, or frankly, what a reasonable officer would think is necessary.”"
