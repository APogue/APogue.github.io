### Notes

- It was implied that the Office of Campus Safety was put in place out of concern for student safety, and as an "olive branch" to those believing UCLA put students in danger during the April protest.

- The Office of Campus Safety has served to "maintain order." 

- Administrative actions meant to safeguard free speech---no interference or oversight, heavy policing targeting students---looks like their strategic plan. This plan is inconsistent with existing policy and data, only serving to chill free speech---UCLA is cannabalizing its own mission.

### Mayor Bass said

- [UCLA’s top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-03/before-mob-attack-ucla-police-chief-was-ordered-to-create-security-plan-but-didnt-sources-say)

	- "The police chief’s remarks offered the first responses to key questions, including when officials decided to bring in help from other agencies and whether help could have arrived sooner. Outside police forces generally do not enter the campus without the university’s approval, since it functions as an independent municipal entity although it is on state land."

	- "Part of the complication in handling the situation is the fact that UCLA is on state land and also functions as an independent municipal entity, meaning outside police forces generally do not enter the campus without the university’s approval.

		“This is essentially a private matter. It’s UCLA’s campus. It’s the school’s decision to call in LAPD,” said Ed Obayashi, a deputy sheriff in Modoc County and a law enforcement advisor to agencies throughout California.

		Three sources familiar with the discussions, but not authorized to speak publicly, said L.A. Mayor Karen Bass called UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and told him the university should agree to deploy the LAPD.

		One source familiar with the discussions, but was not authorized to speak publicly, said Bass strongly encouraged UCLA to deploy the LAPD."

- Karen Bass "shocked and horrified" [statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn9hZ9vbmtI&ab_channel=FOX11LosAngeles)

	- Questions to be answered:

		- Not considered "LAPD" territory---UCPD and CHP respond to calls on UC campuses 

		- Notify law enforcement in advance, can't call backup while events unfolding, when was *mutual aid* called for? 

		- The appropriate "decision makers, where were they?"

		- "Why frankly was the counter-protest happening right next door to the encampment?"

			- Groups can be separated based on content-neutral concerns such as safety and security

		- People need to be held accountable, this might mean someone gets fired, or improvements and recommendations

### Los Angeles City Council

- [Los Angeles City Council requests report on LAPD action at UCLA, USC encampments](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/04/los-angeles-city-council-requests-reports-on-lapd-action-at-ucla-usc-encampments)

	- "Councilmembers Nithya Raman, Katy Yaroslavsky, Marqueece Harris-Dawson and Curren Price introduced the motion May 7. The motion requests an after action report from the interim and eventual chief of LAPD on the department’s actions leading up to and during protests at both universities between April 24 and May 6, including at what time intervention from LAPD was requested."

	- "The motion also requested that LAPD and the Office of Inspector General provide a report on decisions surrounding the size, timing and methodology of LAPD’s deployments at the encampments at UCLA and USC, as well as providing information about any future protocol changes to improve departmental policy."

	- "Raman referred to the April arrests of nonviolent protesters at USC in comparison to the lack of police presence at UCLA during the violent counter-protester attacks April 30 and the morning of May 1

		“I’m concerned that these divergent responses leave our communities with questions and particularly leave our communities wondering whether the response protesters may get from law enforcement depends on their politics rather than on their actions,” Raman said during the meeting. “I would like us as a city to answer some of those questions for the public.”"

- [Motion](https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2024/24-0537_misc_05-07-24.pdf)

	- "At UCLA, a campus that is under the state’s
	jurisdiction, a group of counter-protestors attacked the protest encampment, leading to several
	hours of violence during which law enforcement did not intervene and which resulted in no
	arrests. The following night, approximately 300 officers led by the California Highway Patrol
	and the University of California Police Department with support from the Los Angeles County
	Sheriffs Department and LAPD, were deployed to dismantle the encampment, using less-lethal
	force including stun grenades and rubber bullets.

		At present the protocol for how decisions were made about the number of officers deployed, how
		they were deployed, and when they were deployed has not been made clear to the public.
		Recognizing the complexity of a multi-agency response on state property, it is nevertheless
		incumbent upon the City to be transparent and accountable to Angelenos about how their safety
		and civil rights are being protected, and for that protection to be equally provided regardless of
		one’s politics, identity and protected free speech."

- "As of November 12, 2024, there is no publicly available information indicating that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) or the Office of the Inspector General have released the after-action reports requested by the Los Angeles City Council regarding the department's response to the protests at UCLA and USC between April 24 and May 6, 2024. The motion, introduced on May 7, 2024, called for detailed reports on the LAPD's actions, including the timing, size, and methodology of deployments during the campus encampments. 

	Despite the council's directive, there have been no official releases or public statements confirming the completion or publication of these reports. The absence of these documents has left community members and stakeholders without comprehensive insights into the LAPD's decision-making processes and actions during the specified period."

### Rasha Gerges Shields said

- [Earlier this week,](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/ucla-police-makes-first-arrest-in-connection-with-april-30-attack-on-encampment/), May 25th 

	- "Rasha Gerges Shields, vice president for the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, asked LAPD investigators what they were doing to find assailants involved in violence at UCLA on the night of April 30. She said she had heard concerns from some in the Palestinian and Muslim American communities who were calling for justice.

		"There's a concern that law enforcement's not doing enough to catch the perpetrators," Shields said. "I want to understand what role the department is taking in identifying and bringing to justice to those who were attacking the protesters.""

	- Article also says Eden On was on video assaulting someone with a wooden pole, yet Gascon didn't find enough evidence to bring charges?

		- "Investigators identified him from a video that allegedly shows him assaulting people staying inside the encampment with a wooden pole, leaving a least one person with serious injuries, according to UCLA police. "

### Block messages in the days after 

- Gene Block reflects on the evening before [statement](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/condemning-violence-in-our-community/), May 1, 2024

	- "However one feels about the encampment, this attack on our students, faculty and community members was utterly unacceptable. It has shaken our campus to its core and — adding to other abhorrent incidents that we have witnessed and that have circulated on social media over the past several days — further damaged our community’s sense of security."

- [Chancellor Block shared the following message with the UCLA campus community](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/changes-to-campus-security-operations/), May 5, 2024

	- "Protecting the safety of our community underpins everything we do at UCLA. Our students, faculty and staff can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure.

		In the past week, our campus has been shaken by events that have disturbed this sense of safety and strained trust within our community. In light of this, both UCLA and the UC Office of the President have committed to a thorough investigation of our security processes. But one thing is already clear: To best protect our community moving forward, urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations."

	- "Effective immediately, I am moving oversight and management of UCLA PD and the Office of Emergency Management from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to a newly created Office of Campus Safety, whose leader reports directly to me. It is clear that UCLA needs a unit and leader whose sole responsibility is campus safety to guide us through tense times. This organizational structure, which elevates our safety and emergency management operations, has proven to be an effective one at other major universities across the country.

		Leading the Office of Campus Safety as its inaugural associate vice chancellor is Rick Braziel, who brings to the position more than 30 years of public safety service, including five years as chief of police for the City of Sacramento. Braziel has also served as an instructor in community policing and has led reviews of law enforcement agencies and police responses."

	- "The well-being of our students, faculty and staff is paramount. These actions are essential for creating a secure environment where everyone at UCLA can confidently pursue their studies and careers."

### Block does damage control

- Gene Block testimony [UCLA Policy---Should](https://alexiepogue.com/2024/05/30/In-the-Aftermath-of-the-Protest-Events-People-Should-be-Talking-and-UCLA-Needs-to-Come-to-the-Table/)

	- It was **never stated that the encampment posed a safety risk to students,** although Block cited safety concerns as the reason for removal at the Committee hearing (Figure 56 @ 44:14). 

		- If Block *was aware of the security risks*, and there was no indication students would leave, why weren’t police reinforcements on standby to **head off** any mounting tension? 

		- He was clearly *ignorant of the security risks*, if he didn't know, how could Thomas know?

		- **The administration did not convey the urgency of the matter, to anyone. Safety is why the encampment needed to be cleared right away.**

### Rick Braziel said in the Daily Bruin 

- [UCLA spends millions on pro-Palestine protests, considers attendants to fund costs](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/24/ucla-spends-millions-on-pro-palestine-protests-considers-attendants-to-fund-costs), July 24th

	- “Rick Braziel, associate vice chancellor for the Office of Campus Safety, said an issue the university ran into with its law enforcement for the spring protests is that they did not anticipate every scenario that could happen and plan the appropriate responses. He added that the hasty response time required for the protests made it so the university was “scrambling” to find law enforcement, hiring people at a rate that could have been lower with ample preparation.”

### Rick Braziel LA Times interview

- [Intense UCLA policing draws scrutiny as security chief speaks out on handling protests](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-11/intense-ucla-policing-draws-scrutiny-as-security-chief-speaks-out-on-protests)

- The truth about his "role" at UCLA

	- “In an interview with The Times, Braziel laid out his strategy for overhauling UCLA security operations — and responded to questions and criticism from faculty and others about his role, which is actually a $52,000-a-month short-term position.”

	- "Ariela Gross, a UCLA law professor, was one of several who expressed concern about accountability as Braziel was hired so quickly into such a senior position to start a new administrative office without faculty input — as is generally required under UC’s system of shared governance.

		“When you see something thrown together in a couple of days that hasn’t been vetted but has enormous power, I have concerns,” Gross said. “There’s potential for abuse.”"

	- "But Braziel’s terms of employment are significantly different from public assumptions, based on Block’s announcement. He is not a permanent employee with multiple responsibilities related to campus safety. Braziel’s original contract, obtained by The Times, ended Aug. 31 and has been extended until the end of the year."

	- "He said he hoped to have key changes in place with a plan to move forward to hand off to the incoming chancellor, Julio Frenk, who will take the reins Jan. 1."

	- "Braziel, 64, who lives in Sacramento, said he never had a desire or intention to move to Los Angeles for a long-term job. He said he agreed to a short-term contract to review UCLA’s protest management and suggest institutional changes to improve safety practices after first being contacted by the UC Office of the President and then Block."

	- "He said he understood his other job duties as helping UCLA through a peaceful commencement, and providing updates on security operations to Block, who testified before a congressional committee in May about campus efforts to combat antisemitism and manage protests. Block stepped down July 31."

	- "“I’m the person coming in for just a few months, hopefully fix things, get them moving down the road and then somebody else takes over when I’m gone,” he said."

	- "Braziel said he never agreed to set up the new Office of Campus Safety or **prepare a campus response plan for potential fall protests — tasks that each amount to full-time jobs themselves but that many expected him to take on.** Creating the safety office, he said, would take several employees many months to create a website, complaint intake process, training curriculum, policies and procedures, compliance auditing, staffing and planning for such future events as the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles."

		- What about the investigation on April 30th? Where is it? 

	- "Braziel said he was given no staff or funding for either job but agreed to extend his contract after receiving approval to hire consultants to do them."

	- "The violence of the melee and encampment takedown was predictable, he said, looking at what was happening at Columbia University and other protest hot spots at the time — but UCLA was operating in reactive mode."

	- "“We have to stop playing checkers where you’re waiting for something to happen and respond,” he said. “With chess, you’re constantly looking four, five moves down the board to anticipate what will happen so you can either avoid it or better respond to it.”"

### Wade Stern says

- [UCLA administrators ignored UC policies and now engage in blame-shifting](https://www.dailynews.com/2024/05/08/ucla-administrators-ignored-uc-policies-and-now-engage-in-blame-shifting/)

	- It is not a question of who did what right and who did what wrong, Wade argues this is a matter of whose responsibility this was. Thomas failed to go above and beyond, yes. It doesn't matter, this situation was not his responsibility. 

	- "Ten years ago, the UC system created a comprehensive guide of roles, responsibilities, and planning for the UC system and individual campuses to follow in responding to civil disobedience on campuses. These guidelines remain in effect to this day. As detailed below, this guide calls into question the ongoing attempt by UCLA administrators to **shift blame to law enforcement for the response/lack of response to protests at UCLA.**"

	- "Moreover, **recognizing the pivotal role of campus administrators in protest response**, the guidelines demanded that those administrators be well-trained in protest response. Specifically, the guidelines required UCLA to **“implement formal training of administrators . . . in the areas of crowd management, mediation, de-escalation techniques, the Incident Command System and police force options.”**  This mandatory training was directed to be **conducted annually**, ensuring that current and best practices in protest response would be employed."

	- "However, what unfolded at UCLA calls into question whether **UCLA complied with the guidelines to have in place senior administrators trained in crowd control response, with written plans for response that were the product of scenario training and consultation with its police department and outside law enforcement agencies. The response to protests appears ad hoc and devoid of the structured planning mandated by the UC system.**"

	- "If this is not the case, then it should be easy for the **UCLA administration to identify those administrators who undertook the required annual training in crowd management and response.** UCLA can simply produce the plans developed before these protests, which guided their response, and demonstrate how the response dovetailed with those plans. Finally, the **UCLA administration can also show how it met the required training, briefing, and scenario planning that it was ordered to undertake both with its own police department and outside agencies prior to these protests.**

	- "“My office has requested a detailed accounting from the campus about what transpired in the early morning hours today,” Drake said on Tuesday. “But some confusion remains. Therefore, we are also ordering an independent external review of both UCLA’s planning and actions, and the effectiveness of the mutual aid response.”"

	- "UC President Michael V. Drake, in a letter to the University of California Board of Regents obtained by The Times, said the way the incident was handled requires an outside inquiry.

		“There is sufficient confusion that I am ordering an independent external review of UCLA’s planning and its actions and of the mutual aid response” by law enforcement, he wrote in the letter. “I believe such a review can address many of my immediate questions but also help guide us for possible future events.”"

### UC Regents 

- [UCLA spends millions on pro-Palestine protests, considers attendants to fund costs](https://dailybruin.com/2024/07/24/ucla-spends-millions-on-pro-palestine-protests-considers-attendants-to-fund-costs), updated July 29 at 10:19 a.m.

	- "UCLA spent over $12 million in relation to spring pro-Palestine protests, according to estimates obtained by the Daily Bruin.

		The university **spent $11,781,917 on security and law enforcement, including mutual aid with outside law enforcement agencies, private security and overtime payment for UC employees during the spring quarter**, according to a preliminary estimate from the UCLA Compliance Office. Another $471,760 was spent on cleanup – including the repair of items damaged by vandalism, for a total of nearly $12.3 million in protest-related costs.

		The university is considering collecting the money – the highest figure across the UC – from protest participants.

		This $12.3 million disclosure by UCLA is higher than UC Office of the President estimates previously reported by the Los Angeles Times. Jorge Silva, the UC’s associate vice president for communications, **said the numbers from UCOP were from June 25 and that the estimate from the UCLA Compliance Office would be more accurate as of July 18.**"

		- The cost difference is likely from June 10th

- "[UC unveils steep price tag for handling campus protests: $29 million, most for policing](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-18/uc-unveils-price-tag-for-this-springs-campus-unrest), July 18th

	- "**UCLA topped all 10 campuses in costs, spending $10 million on safety and security** and $400,000 for building repairs, graffiti removal and other cleanup between March 1 and June 25."

	- "UC Board of Regents Chair Janet Reilly said regents were aware that the costs of handling protests could be high but they **backed efforts to do what was needed to restore campus safety.**"

		"“In several instances over the past several months, UC campus leaders were put in extraordinarily challenging situations,” Reilly said in a statement to The Times. “We supported our chancellors’ decisions to do what they needed to protect our campus communities and enable students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors to attend and teach classes, access medical care, get to work, continue research activities, and safely access public facilities. **Our top priority is, and always will be, the safety of our community.**”"

	- "The university is under pressure from state lawmakers to better control protests and develop a systemwide framework to provide consistent enforcement of rules. The state is withholding $25 million in funding until UC submits a report to the Legislature by Oct. 1 on university efforts to consistently enforce policies and laws “that protect safety and access to educational opportunities and campus spaces and buildings.” The report must also include information about how UC carries out a state directive to notify all students by the beginning of fall term about rules around free speech activities and consequences for violating them."

		- This is part of the state budget bills and is located in the policy doc



### Police union said

- [UCLA sought extra police but canceled requests in days before protest camp was attacked](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-02/ucla-canceled-campus-police-requests-for-outside-help)
	
	- "Stern’s union put out a statement Wednesday noting that the police departments across the UC system take their orders from the chancellors of the schools."

	- "“When protests erupt on campus, the decisions regarding the response of the UC Police rest firmly in the hands of campus leadership,” the union said in a statement."

	- "The union noted the difference between “operational execution,” which was under the departments, compared to “strategic direction,” which was controlled by the school administrators, according to the statement."

### Arrests

- [USAC officers announce additional arrests, warrants related to encampment attack](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/18/usac-officers-announce-additional-arrests-warrants-related-to-encampment-attack)

	- "The report said two individuals have been arrested on felony charges with primary hearings scheduled, and two more individuals have active warrants for arrest – one with a felony warrant and one with a misdemeanor warrant. The report also said there is one additional case being reviewed by United States Attorney for the Central District of California E. Martin Estrada’s office."

	- "One of the individuals with felony charges was Eyal Shalom – who was coined by several accounts as “#UCLAMaroonHoodie” on X, formerly Twitter. Shalom was arrested for illegal use of tear gas May 1. Journalist Dolores Quintana took to X in May saying Shalom pepper sprayed her in the eye, while another man shone a light on her face." 

	- [Eyal Shalom sprays journalist directly in the face](https://x.com/doloresquintana/status/1794899214734184806) (video evidence)

	- [CNN identified Eden On and Marlan-Librett](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html)---

		- "The other individual arrested with felony charges, Malachi Joshua Marlan-Librett, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon – not firearm – as well as special circumstance allegations of a hate crime and a use of a deadly weapon from May 1. Marlan-Librett, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2020, was also charged with two felony counts of battery from April 28. 

		Marlan-Librett – who was first identified by CNN as an April 30 attacker in May – is set to have a preliminary hearing Nov. 22 at Airport Courthouse."

		- Eyal Shalom is also pictured in the CNN report

- [USAC transparency report](https://www.instagram.com/uclapresident/p/DBSOoJSSp2S/?img_index=1)

	- "As of now, two individuals have been arrested on felony charges, and their primary hearings have been scheduled. Additionally, two more individuals have active warrants being processed by the District Attorney's office. One individual has a felony warrant issued, while another, initially charged with a felony, had their charged reclassified as a misdemeanor by the judge. Lastly there is one case currently being reviewed by the US Attorneys Office."

	- The reclassified individual is likely Edan On (below)

### At other UC campuses, encampments went on undisturbed

- UC Irvine chancellor

	- He reaches out directly to the encampment

	- It seemed with UCLA they were communicating through the Daily Bruin, the People's Council or some other 3rd party channel

	- That is incredibly unsafe not to try to interact with them directly 

- [UC’s President had a Plan to De-Escalate Protests. How did a Night of Violence Happen at UCLA?](https://www.kqed.org/news/11984762/ucs-campus-safety-plan-under-fire-as-violence-breaks-out-at-ucla-protest)	

	- "UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich described the decision to involve five law enforcement departments as “a standard response” for situations where the campus needs support while simultaneously describing the protest as a “very peaceful environment.” He attributed the police response to potential trespassing violations from people not affiliated with the university.

		“This isn’t a free speech issue, this is a trespassing issue,” Vasich said."

	- [This Chancellor Update](https://chancellor.uci.edu/communications/campus/2024/240429-campus-activity-update.php) from UC Irvine is enlightening 

	- I believe in this case, "non-affiliates are pro-Palestinian protesters"

	- The non-affiliates at UCLA were carrying weapons, harassing and spewing hate speech, getting aggressive and physical---none of this qualifies as trespassing? 

	- He negotiated with the encampment, at least

- [UC regents: Protests yes, encampments no. Campus rules must be consistently enforced](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-15/uc-regents-say-no-to-encampments-and-codes-must-be-enforced#:~:text=%E2%80%9CEncampments%20are%20not%20allowed%2C%E2%80%9D,been%20in%20place%20since%202017.%E2%80%9D)

	- "Chancellors at Irvine, San Diego, Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara also called in law enforcement to dismantle the tents following the UCLA debacle. Students ended their encampments voluntarily without police action at UC Riverside, UC Davis, UC Merced and UC San Francisco."

	- "UC Berkeley was the first UC campus to allow an encampment on April 22 — and then-Chancellor Carol Christ resisted pressure from regents and others to dismantle it, saying she knew what was best for her university. Three weeks later, the protesters voluntarily dismantled the encampment without police action after Christ forged an agreement to review university investments and academic exchange programs while making clear that targeting Israel was off the table."

	- "Leib said he never directed any campus to remove an encampment but “strongly encouraged” it. He said he repeatedly asked UC Santa Barbara leaders, for instance, what their plan was to end the encampment, which lasted 54 days until police dismantled it June 23 and arrested six people. He also monitored negotiations between campus administrators and protesters at Berkeley and UC Davis to make sure they crossed no red lines — including targeting Israel or violating state laws."

	- "Students vow to continue protests, said Rebecca Hurtado Fairweather, who participated in the UC Santa Barbara “Liberated Zone Encampment” before graduating last month.

		“Tents don’t make a movement, people make a movement,” Fairweather said. “People will find a way to show up in the way they want. If the system is not willing to work with us, then we have to work outside the system.”"


### Equal enforcement of encampments 

- [UC regents: Protests yes, encampments no. Campus rules must be consistently enforced](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-15/uc-regents-say-no-to-encampments-and-codes-must-be-enforced#:~:text=%E2%80%9CEncampments%20are%20not%20allowed%2C%E2%80%9D,been%20in%20place%20since%202017.%E2%80%9D)

	- "Although many UC leaders are now calling for more consistent enforcement of campus rules, it’s not as easy as it sounds."

	- "For example, how should prohibited camping be defined? UCLA students routinely line up overnight with sleeping bags to nab coveted tickets to sports events. UC Berkeley students last year protested plans to close the anthropology library by camping there for nearly three months before ending the sleep-in due to a campus compromise to keep it open as a reading room. UC Riverside academic workers occupied a building for a week during the 2022 strike. Should they all have been swept out by police?"

		"“How can we have a one size fits all? UC has never done that,” said one senior UC administrator, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic."
