### True disruptions to campus operations 

- Encampment blockading 

	- Reddit---people can't get to class, their jobs, disabled people are denied access to campus

- The marching through the halls with chants of "From the River to the Sea" (TikTok)

	- [Pro-Palestinian protesters took over UCLA's Dodd Hall](https://www.tiktok.com/@journalistjeremy/video/7372692453956062507)


	- [UCLA faces scrutiny for safety issues at protests for Israel, Palestine](https://dailybruin.com/2023/12/05/ucla-faces-scrutiny-for-safety-issues-at-protests-for-israel-palestine)

		- Additionally, at recent protests in support of Palestine, protesters have chanted phrases such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” and “Resistance is justified when people are occupied.” Some members of the campus community said they were concerned that the chants were antisemitic.

		- However, Vazquez said in the statement that the university does not restrict or control the views shared by student groups.

- The screen that UCLA permitted to stay without permit 

	- Reddit quote

	- [Hillel comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HqCOvk9-i0iW2xlYqvjQGyzjWDmIzjn/view), "There is a screen placed by community members at UCLA playing the horrors of October 7th on repeat--and we
	can’t learn over the constant noise of Jews being slaughtered. The wider community is prioritizing their own idea of
	activism over what Jewish students want. We want peace and a diplomatic resolution."


### A hostile environment by totality of circumstances 

- This is where the symbology and random antisemitic incidents should go towards the total

	- From the lawsuit

	- From the task force report


- Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

	- [Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"


### Illustrate free speech, treated as protected 

- Extreme political positions

	- Moshiach flag guy 

	- [Example 2, Oct 30th](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17k6sx8/islamophobes_on_campus/)

- May cause tensions to flare, UCLA won't get involved 

	- February rally 

		- Heckling 

### UCAC lack of condemnation of student orgs and members

- UC Divest "shut it down" (police footage) [IG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C51p_t2SMCH/?hl=en)

	- UC Divest in the above claims that UCPD, LAPD, Culver City PD, and Santa Monica PD were all on the scene

	- 100 plus cops were there
	

### Illustrate free speech, unprotected---treated as a gray area

- When "equal rights give way to free speech"---UCLA permits more extreme cases of discrimination

	- Given the state of campus climate, by totality of circumstances, removal was appropriate 

		- Did not remove it, waited to condemn it 

		- Did not hold anyone accountable (UC Divest)

	- Impactful discriminatory art at a larger-scale protest

		- Made it into social media posts, Op-eds, news articles (which news articles?)

- The April 30th protest was a hotbed for hate speech and discrimination 

	- Instances of discrimination quietly removed

		- Students mentioned they wanted to leave campus due to "clear signs of discrimination" happening 

		- Triangles made it into several articles as the "face of the protest"
	
		- No acknowledgment

### The encampment 

- “Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by 	the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and 			Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. ‘I feel very uncomfortable,’ he said. ‘I might skip my 		classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on 			campus.’” [Student onlookers express differing opinions on pro-Palestine encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment)
