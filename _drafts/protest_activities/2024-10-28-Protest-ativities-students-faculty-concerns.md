Thesis: UCLA can protect free speech on its campus, but it will require it to be more than "a bank that holds classes."


### What do the students and faculty actually want 

- To feel safe on campus

- Less militarization of campus

	- "But if any kind of reconciliation is at all possible, the administration must lay a new foundation for the future. In our view, the process has to begin with this first step.

	Apologize."

### Hillel response 

- While their statement is well-meaning, it is the job of the administration to handle *any* violation of the law in a content-neutral manner. They don't need to single out a single group the way Hillel has. But they do need to hold people accountable. It is about safety through accountability---rhetoric, strategic direction, and policy.

	- "The truth is that a largely peaceful, pro-Palestinian encampment was attacked by an angry, violent mob comprised
	of fringe members of the off-campus Jewish community last night. They do not represent the estimated 3,000
	Jewish Bruins at UCLA, yet those are precisely the people who will have to live with the reverberations of their
	aggressive actions. 

		**We can not have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus. Do not fund any actions on campus. Do not protest on campus. Your actions are harming Jewish students."**

		- The funding may be referring to the Go Fund Me campaign that raised 80k



### Injuries

	- "Boosinger underwent surgery in May and is still wearing a brace to protect her hand. She said a detective interviewed her soon after the attack, but that she hasn’t heard anything since.

		“The detective asked me very vaguely if I could pick someone out of a lineup, but she never asked me to actually do it,” Boosinger said. “I don't have any faith in the police.""

	- "Law enforcement did not track injuries from the attack. But according to the encampment’s organizers, more than 150 students “were assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,” and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms to receive treatment for injuries including fractures, severe lacerations and chemical-induced injuries.

		“I actually thought someone would get killed,” said Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, UCLA Hillel’s Director Emeritus, who called 911 around midnight as he watched the violence on live TV. “They came to beat people up.”"

	- "Robin D.G. Kelley, a UCLA professor of American history, spent the night in the hospital with his student who was shot in the chest with a projectile during the June 10 protest. The student, hospitalized for two days, suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised lung and remains so traumatized that they have postponed law school studies, Kelley said."

		- "“The obvious burning question is this: Why does UCLA or any university campus need this kind of weaponry?” Kelley said. “Clearly the weapons are not to keep mobs off campus; they are to be used against our students and us.”"

	- Less-than-lethal rounds still have the potential to cause serious injury, Sierra-Arévalo said. At a Faculty for Justice in Palestine at UCLA press conference Thursday outside of Charles E. Young Research Library, a medic who treated patients the night of the sweep said they evaluated over a dozen students for rubber bullet injuries, such as **bone fractures, golf-ball sized contusions, and eye, scalp, face and body lacerations.**

	- "Students also have complained. One third-year student, who declined to give his full name because of retaliation, said the heavy security presence was “complete overkill” and did not make him feel safe. “I don’t feel they are on campus to protect me and my peers,” he said. “I didn’t see them step in when the encampment was being attacked. They had a chance to do something and they procrastinated.”"

### FJP

- [Op-ed: Rick Braziel’s messaging belies disregard for police accountability, student safety](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/18/op-ed-rick-braziels-messaging-belies-disregard-for-police-accountability-student-safety)

	- "It’s not clear if he understands the function and nature of life on a university campus: He seems to regard student protest as inherently illegitimate and illegal by default; his reactive impulse to any sign of student activism is to police violence as a first response."

	- "Since the university has contracted several different security companies – some with murky reputations – and there were several different law enforcement agencies on campus, it was difficult to tell who was actually in charge, or whether, having washed its hands of its duty of care to its own students, the upper administration was content to have handed over campus to a loose confederation of police officers acting more or less on their own volition."

	- In claiming that protestors “prevented students from completing their final exams” or “entering classrooms,” he again ignores the fact that there would have been no disruptions to campus activities if the students had not been forced to relocate from one site to another by the police – and that the police themselves, not the students, were the ones blocking access to buildings and facilities and evicting students and instructors while exams were underway.

		- It can't be proven whether their encampments were blocking free access to campus, so the above may be only partially true

	- "What stands out above all in Braziel’s message, in fact, is his total disregard for our students, his contempt for their right to express themselves and his inability to recognize that UCLA is a university, not an armed camp run by militarized police."

	- "If June 10’s protest was “not peaceful,” as Braziel states, it was because of the police. And if “the campus community belongs to all of us and we must model the respect we expect to receive from others,” then Braziel and his junta should expect nothing less than continued escalation unless they try to adapt themselves to the norms of our community, rather than trying to compress us into theirs."

	- "In any case, although Braziel has supplanted the recognized authorities on our campus – above all the now silent and invisible chancellor and provost – his reckless disregard for our students and our values is ultimately their responsibility."

	- "We demand that they bring their policemen back under their control, that they restore cultural, political and intellectual order to our campus community by protecting rather than punishing expression and protest, and that they take steps to allow this community to breathe freely once more by reducing or eliminating – rather than enhancing – the police presence on campus."

- The main issue with the arrests is, while the encampments were illegal, and looked like they were building barricades, the arrests and disruptions came from the "kettling" incident.

	- "The guide assumes both that antisemitism is a real problem in our society and that not all harsh criticism of Israel is antisemitic. Indeed, political speech may be painful or offensive to people who identify strongly with Israel without being antisemitic."

		- When something is defined as subjectively offensive, they are no longer discriminating

	- "Just as Jewish students have felt attacked for supporting Israel, so too have students who support the pro-Palestine movement felt attacked for their views. They faced hostility from right-wing, pro-Israel counter-demonstrators, a deaf ear from university leaders and often violent responses from law enforcement. Moreover, they were frequently accused of being antisemitic because of their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel even though a noticeable contingent of Jews participated in the protests."

	- His questions regarding antisemitism are narrower than the Title VI guidelines on discrimination 

	- "For example, the guide maintains that the phrase “From the river to the sea” is not antisemitic if it’s proposing a single state in which all citizens, Jewish and Palestinian, have equal rights. By contrast, if the phrase is a call to eliminate Jews from the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean or to relegate them to second-class status, it is antisemitic."

### Student demands

- [Dueling Gaza protests at UCLA draw hundreds as USC sees peaceful demonstration](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-28/gaza-ucla-usc-protests)

	- "The director of UCLA’s Nazarian Center, a nexus for both social and political Israeli studies, took to X on Saturday to voice support for those who oppose Israel’s blockade and destruction of Gaza. But Dov Waxman drew the line at a demand for UCLA to sever connections to Israeli universities and foreign study programs."

	- "“The Center is devoted to the academic study of Israel and has no ties to the Israeli government,” Waxman wrote. Further, Waxman singled out one of the groups he said is organizing campus protests, Students for Justice in Palestine. Waxman said the group has voiced support for Hamas."

	- “The University of California has consistently opposed calls for boycotts against and divestment from Israel,” the statement said. “While the University affirms the right of our community members to express diverse viewpoints, a boycott of this sort impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses.”

### Faculty reactions

	- "UC lecturers were quick to call for Block’s resignation on Wednesday, citing the mismanagement of police and security response to the overnight violence. He had already planned to step down on July 31.

		“**Chancellor Block has refused to meet with protesters to discuss their interests;** instead, he has created an environment that has escalated tensions and failed to take meaningful action to prevent the violence that occurred last night,” the UC lecturers’ statement read."
