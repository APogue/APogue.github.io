	- JVP doesn't interact with CAC, despite the fact that they were also present at the encampment

### True disruptions to campus operations 

- Encampment blockading 

	- Reddit---people can't get to class, their jobs, disabled people are denied access to campus

- The marching through the halls with chants of "From the River to the Sea" (TikTok)

		- Additionally, at recent protests in support of Palestine, protesters have chanted phrases such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” and “Resistance is justified when people are occupied.” Some members of the campus community said they were concerned that the chants were antisemitic.

		- However, Vazquez said in the statement that the university does not restrict or control the views shared by student groups.

- The screen that UCLA permitted to stay without permit 

	- Reddit quote

	- [Hillel comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HqCOvk9-i0iW2xlYqvjQGyzjWDmIzjn/view), "There is a screen placed by community members at UCLA playing the horrors of October 7th on repeat--and we
	can’t learn over the constant noise of Jews being slaughtered. The wider community is prioritizing their own idea of
	activism over what Jewish students want. We want peace and a diplomatic resolution."


### A hostile environment by totality of circumstances 

- This is where the symbology and random antisemitic incidents should go towards the total

	- From the lawsuit

	- From the task force report


- Nov 8th incident, [Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus](https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/19/jewish-students-express-concern-over-antisemitism-on-ucla-campus)

	- [Los Angeles Magazine article](https://lamag.com/news/ucla-condemns-pro-palestinian-student-protesters-antisemitic-behavior), dated Nov 12, that states students “went viral online Friday for screaming ‘beat that fucking Jew’ through a megaphone while bashing a piñata bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”"


- The Nov 8th incident warranted [condemnation by Block and Drake](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/standing-against-bigotry-at-the-university-of-california) on Nov 10th, although the previous incident was not explicitly condemned. 

	- "Today, I joined University of California President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors in issuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses — including UCLA — over the past several weeks. We must be crystal clear: discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding."

		 "At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable."


### Illustrate free speech, treated as protected 

- Extreme political positions

	- [Example 2, Oct 30th](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/17k6sx8/islamophobes_on_campus/)

- May cause tensions to flare, UCLA won't get involved 

	- February rally 

		- Heckling 




### The encampment 

- The April 30th protest was a hotbed for hate speech and discrimination 

	- Instances of discrimination quietly removed

		- Students mentioned they wanted to leave campus due to "clear signs of discrimination" happening 

		- Triangles made it into several articles as the "face of the protest"
	
		- No acknowledgment

- “Lavie Levi, a fourth-year mathematics of computation student who is Jewish, said he felt uncomfortable and threatened by 	the encampment, adding that he believes some of the imagery used by the protesters – such as the red triangle and 			Chancellor Gene Block with horns on his head – is antisemitic. ‘I feel very uncomfortable,’ he said. ‘I might skip my 		classes today and go home because of the clear signs of antisemitism that I see that are not being reprimanded on 			campus.’” [Student onlookers express differing opinions on pro-Palestine encampment](https://dailybruin.com/2024/04/25/student-onlookers-express-differing-opinions-on-pro-palestine-encampment)

	- "Private security guards with bikes separated the pro-Palestinian group from Israel supporters, and UCLA eventually added metal barricades after counter-protesters repeatedly tried to breach the encampment and in at least one case witnessed by The Times entered and shoved a woman to the ground."

	- Heckler's veto

		- "Soon after protesters, most of them students at the Westwood campus, pitched tents on Dickson Court on April 25, pro-Israel counterdemonstrators showed up with megaphones. Some shouted racist, homophobic and anti-Islamic slurs, according to campers interviewed."

		- "...They returned night after night."

		- "On Tuesday night, Dickson Court exploded into savagery and chaos. A large, mostly male crowd of masked counterdemonstrators tried to break into the encampment, ripping down wood and metal barriers, spraying bear mace, igniting stink bombs and tossing fireworks near the camp perimeter — and in at least one case inside the camp.

			They aimed their green lasers at camper’s faces, prompting shouts of, “Shield your eyes!”"

		- "Tajima-Peña was on campus Sunday when campers tussled with pro-Israel counterdemonstrators, who, she said, spit at students and shouted racial slurs.

			“I was shoved by a guy a foot taller than me,” she said. “Another woman, a colleague of mine, also got shoved by some guy."

	- "USC’s campus has been closed to the general public since Friday, with access restricted to residents and registered visitors. Further steps were hinted at with the approach of commencement ceremonies starting May 8. The traditional central ceremony has been canceled but separate events for individual schools are still planned."

	- "Across the lawn, demonstrators carried signs that ranged from a handmade “Free Hugs Jewish Students” to pre-printed “I go bananas for Israel” — a taunt aimed at reports of someone with a banana allergy in the pro-Palestinian encampment, now encircled by a protective wall of plywood. Through gaps in the wood, a person waved a large Palestinian flag."

- "At about 4 a.m. Wednesday, a small group of student journalists for the Daily Bruin, including Christopher Buchanan, a student fellow for the CalMatters College Journalism Network, were confronted by a group of counterprotesters who began berating them. They targeted the staff’s news editor, calling her names, and blocked the journalists’ route to the Daily Bruin office. One shined a strobe light into Buchanan’s face while others attacked him as he fell to the ground.

	“After I was struck and debilitated, I was surrounded by four to seven counterprotesters who proceeded to punch and kick my head and torso for thirty seconds to a minute,” Buchanan said. “I didn’t sustain any internal injuries, but I was badly bruised on the body and face.”

	Buchanan said this all happened within earshot of CHP officials, who did nothing to intervene."

	- Daily Bruin news editor Catherine Hamilton, 21, told The Times she recognized one of the counterprotesters as someone who had previously verbally harassed her and taken pictures of her press badge. The individual instructed the group to encircle the student journalists, she said, before they sprayed the four with Mace or pepper spray, flashed lights in their faces and chanted Hamilton’s name.

		As she tried to break free, Hamilton said, she was punched repeatedly in the chest and upper abdomen; another student journalist was pushed to the ground and beaten and kicked for nearly a minute. The attack was first reported in the Daily Bruin.

	- "“We expected to be harassed by counterprotesters,” Hamilton said in an interview Wednesday, adding that every Daily Bruin reporter was instructed to use a buddy system, to report from outside the encampment and to leave the area if it became unsafe. “I truly did not expect to be directly assaulted.”"

		"The incident lasted about five minutes. The group of four made their way to the Daily Bruin newsroom before Hamilton went to the hospital, accompanied by her editor in chief, when the bruising made it difficult for her to stand and breathe. She has since been released."

	- "The attack is one of several recent incidents involving journalists. It also is one of the first known attacks involving student reporters covering the ongoing unrest on campuses over the Israel-Hamas war, often when outside news media have been prevented from entering universities."
