	- "I’ll upload a more complete clip later but it was about 10 minutes of sustained pushing and a few less lethal. Was briefly told I was under arrest. The crowd was pushed into a hallway, Saw some people looking crushed."

	- Why didn't they do this on April 30th? 

- [SJP take](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8GD2LXSLM9/?hl=en&img_index=3), is interesting, because in the police press release they didn't explicitly say they gave dispersal orders near the law school.

	- "They gave us barely audible dispersal orders *after* they invaded the camp and started arresting. Even then, there was nowhere to go, their dispersal directions led us to the line of officers behind us. **We tried to leave. THEY TRAPPED US INSIDE**...They arrested dozens of students, zip tied them and held them captive in Dodd Hall *for hours*."

	- The entire video is relevant (excessive use of force throughout, especially with the two individuals near the end)

	- At 2:30 the press person is told to leave the bushes Dodd area and is met with the line of police that the CBS video below shows from bird's eye view (they are kettling them)

	- At 4:30 look closely at the 3rd quadrant you can see the line of police behind them, **they are kettling them**

	- "We've never seen what Desmond was just talking about, such close corridors like this? With the protesters and police. Which is a little concerning to be honest." 6:20 min

- June 11th, no statement made by Gene Block

	- [UCPD statement](https://ucla.app.box.com/v/Arrests-241105-06102024)

		- Describes 3 encampment setups and 2 explicit dispersal orders

		- "The group then marched to the courtyard between Dodd Hall and the School of Law, where they **set up another
		unauthorized and unlawful encampment.** The group **restricted access to the general public** in violation of
		University policy and also **disrupted nearby final exams.** At around 8:00 p.m. approximately 25 members of
		the group were arrested for **California Penal Code section 626.4(d) – Willful Disruption of University
		Operations.** The individuals are in the process of being cited, issued 14-day stay away orders from UCLA
		property, and released. Approximately 150 protesters remain in the area as of the latest update."

			"In addition, as the first encampment was setting up, one individual was arrested at Royce Quad for **California
			Penal Code section 148(a)(1) PC** for interfering with a police officer. That individual was cited and released."

	- [Rick Braziel statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/condemning-mondays-violence-on-campus)

		- "**Condemning Monday's violence on campus**"

		- "When the group on Kerckhoff patio was told to disperse, they moved to an area near Dodd Hall. This resulted in some students having to miss finals because they were blocked from entering classrooms. Additionally, some students had to be evacuated in the middle of taking their final exams. 

			Throughout the evening, there were also violent attacks on safety personnel and law enforcement, resulting in at least six injuries to UCPD personnel and other safety officers. One security guard was left with his head bleeding after he was struck with an object. Simply put, these acts of non-peaceful protest are abhorrent and cannot continue. 

			During these events, 27 individuals were arrested. We are still determining which arrestees are not members of the UCLA community. Students who were arrested will be subject to disciplinary actions based on UCOP guidance, which could include a campus exclusion that will prevent them from being on campus to take finals or participate in commencement ceremonies.

			Yesterday’s protest was not peaceful. These guidelines support advocacy that does not jeopardize safety or disrupt university operations."

- Injuries 

	- 1 student hospitalized 

	- [UC police seek approval for more pepper balls, sponge rounds, launchers, drones](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-19/pepper-balls-sponge-rounds-launchers-drones-uc-police-ask-for-these-weapons)

		- "Robin D.G. Kelley, a UCLA professor of American history, spent the night in the hospital with his student who was shot in the chest with a projectile during the June 10 protest. The student, hospitalized for two days, suffered a contusion to the heart and a bruised lung and remains so traumatized that they have postponed law school studies, Kelley said."

		- "“The obvious burning question is this: Why does UCLA or any university campus need this kind of weaponry?” Kelley said. “Clearly the weapons are not to keep mobs off campus; they are to be used against our students and us.”"

- Arrests 

	- Of the 27 arrested, 25 were arrested for disruption of university operations and 1 arrested for interfering with a police officer, and 1 unknown because Braziel’s numbers don’t match the UCPD statement. This is out of approximately 175 total protesters.

	- [According to the DB](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/10/pro-palestine-protesters-set-up-3rd-solidarity-encampment-in-dickson-plaza), the individual arrested for interfering with police was USAC president Adam Tfayli 

- Reactions 

	- [Op-ed: Rick Braziel’s messaging belies disregard for police accountability, student safety](https://dailybruin.com/2024/06/18/op-ed-rick-braziels-messaging-belies-disregard-for-police-accountability-student-safety), FJP, June 18, 2024 

		- "Braziel was appointed overnight in a process that lacked transparency and input from the campus community he now governs arbitrarily, totally disregarding fundamental principles of academic freedom and constitutionally protected forms of freedom of expression."

		- “It’s not clear if he understands the function and nature of life on a university campus: He seems to regard student protest as inherently illegitimate and illegal by default; his reactive impulse to any sign of student activism is to police violence as a first response.”

		- "In claiming that protestors “prevented students from completing their final exams” or “entering classrooms,” he again ignores the fact that there would have been no disruptions to campus activities if the students had not been forced to relocate from one site to another by the police – and that the police themselves, not the students, were the ones blocking access to buildings and facilities and evicting students and instructors while exams were underway."

		- “In any case, although Braziel has supplanted the recognized authorities on our campus – above all the now silent and invisible chancellor and provost – his reckless disregard for our students and our values is ultimately their responsibility.”

		- “We demand that they bring their policemen back under their control, that they restore cultural, political and intellectual order to our campus community by protecting rather than punishing expression and protest, and that they take steps to allow this community to breathe freely once more by reducing or eliminating – rather than enhancing – the police presence on campus.”

- [Op-ed: Admin’s actions toward pro-Palestine protesters proves UCLA wants us dead](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/03/op-ed-admin-complacency-in-attacks-on-pro-palestine-protesters-proves-ucla-wants-us-dead), published Oct. 3, 2024, talks about April 30th and June 10th incidents

	- "During our June 10 protest, police aimlessly fired less-than-lethal weapons – hospitalizing one student and injuring several others with the rubber bullets that ricocheted through the crowd of trapped protesters. They continued firing countless pepper balls, hitting several students and causing them to limp to finals over the next few days. Several students became concussed from violent police takedowns, with one student violently yanked into the police line for speaking into a megaphone."

		- Is all of the above factually true? Were students really concussed? That would be a big deal. 

	- "Once police seemingly finished their job clearing each successive protest, UCLA abandoned us to defend ourselves against the ensuing counter-protesters – including many repeaters from the Zionist mob attack."

	- "Zionist counter-protesters would target and encircle individual protesters, barraging them with a combination of racist slurs, sexually-explicit harassment if perceived female and incendiary threats to provoke a recorded reaction."

	- "Following a Dodd Hall dispersal in late May, I was stalked, surrounded, harassed and threatened by a group of counter-protesters, one of whom claimed to have my address and told me I wouldn’t be safe at home."

	- "My friend had a Zionist slash their leg with a knife, which caused them to limp around campus. Others were stalked home and subjected to hateful vitriol at their doorstep. Our mutual aid and food distributions received passing cars launching tomatoes, eggs, milkshakes and other food items at us. All these incidents are known – and not uncommon – with UCLA continually failing to take action."

		- When did this happen? 

	- "During the June 10 protest, I asked Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck on his plans following our dispersal, with several Zionist onlookers – whom I recognized from the encampment attack – screaming epithets in the background. Beck halfheartedly responded, “UCPD is watching them and will deal with it.” Hours later, as we waited outside for our friends to be released, UCPD and campus security faded into nearby buildings, leaving us to the Zionist onslaught."


### LA Times article 

- [Police arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian students in L.A. The fallout continues, Aug. 2, 2024](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-02/ucla-usc-pomona-palestinian-protests)

	- “Since police arrested her twice this spring at UCLA — accusing her of failing to obey orders to leave pro-Palestinian encampments — Asil Yassine has spent the summer navigating court dates and uncertainties. No criminal charges have been filed in one case, although it has not been dropped. In the other, an arraignment is coming up in late August. The consequences of her arrests are piling up.”

	- “Yassine was temporarily banned from campus and could not attend her graduation, where she would have received a doctorate in human development and psychology. The university placed holds on her records and she still has not received her diploma. Without proof of her degree, her work this summer at a psychology office won’t count toward her license. “I’m not surprised by the oppression but I’m shocked by the extent and aggression of it and how punitive it was,” said Yassine, who is of Palestinian and Lebanese heritage.”

	- “About three months since 231 UCLA protesters were arrested, most on misdemeanor charges, the Los Angeles city attorney’s office has not received referrals involving those cases, a spokesman said. The city attorney typically handles misdemeanor charges. There is a one-year period in which charges can be filed in misdemeanor cases.”


### Oct 7th 

- [Intense UCLA policing draws scrutiny as security chief speaks out on handling protests](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-11/intense-ucla-policing-draws-scrutiny-as-security-chief-speaks-out-on-protests)

- "Braziel led a large behind-the-scenes operation that culminated in peaceful Oct. 7 protests"

- "A tense moment came when pro-Palestinian supporters marched into a campus area off-limits to protest activities and initially refused to leave after student affairs staff told them they were violating campus rules.

		Police were called in. They determined protesters were not breaking any laws. The protesters moved on and the night ended with no arrests, no significant confrontations — and, in an intentional UCLA effort to create a calmer environment, no visible massive mobilization of police in riot gear wielding batons."

- "“My vision is a beautiful campus where people feel safe and comfortable with each other and police are seen as part of the family, not an invading army,” Braziel said. “It’s not a one-person fix. It’s going to take a whole team of experts from inside and outside the UCLA organization to create positive change.”"

- On Oct. 7, he said, he and his team had fully staffed up — deploying all 51 campus police officers available that day, tripling normal private security staffing to 158 officers, bringing some UC San Francisco officers to UCLA and requesting LAPD forces to stand by on campus.”

	“But he kept most of the officers out of sight inside buildings, close enough to intervene if needed but without presenting a negative “visual impact,” he said. Police had their riot gear ready but did not wear it, an intentional decision.”

	““If you dress for a riot, you’re going to get a riot,” Braziel said. “The visual is super important to the response you’re going to get.””

	“He declined to comment on why no university action was taken against pro-Palestinian students who refused to comply with protest rules on approved free speech zones and amplified-sound restrictions. He said police did not arrest anyone because protesters were not significantly disrupting campus operations, the trigger to declare an unlawful assembly and cite them if they refuse to leave."

- [Insta Post by JVP at UCLA 10-23](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBfBe0Gg2SW/?hl=en&img_index=4)

	- "In observance of the holiday of Sukkot, Jewish students at UCLA erected a Gaza Solidarity Sukkah. They adorned the Sukkah with handmade decorations, photos of anti-Zionist Jewish ancestors, and banners that read “Stop Arming Israel.” They were joined by other students of conscience, members of Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, who gathered to join in prayer and protest.

	Then, pro-genocide agitators and UCLA administrators tore their Sukkah down.

	First, agitators surrounded the Sukkah and taunted the students with slurs and threats. Then, police in riot gear then arrived to clear the area, allowing agitators to begin tearing down handmade decorations. Finally, facilities workers sent by UCLA admin completed the destruction of this sacred dwelling.

	In keeping with Jewish tradition, students intended to eat and sleep in the Sukkah—a ritual in remembrance of Jewish ancestors forced to live in temporary structures in the desert while fleeing slavery. This year, students could not separate their observance from the fact that tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to live in temporary shelters due to the Israeli military's mass destruction of homes in Gaza. Jewish students across the country are observing Sukkot by erecting solidarity Sukkahs dedicated to Gaza and to Palestinian liberation.

	As UCLA allowed for the destruction of a sacred Jewish religious structure, the truth was clear: the University does not care about actual experiences of antisemitism—only about how it can use concerns about the “safety” of Jewish students to suppress anyone who dares to speak out for Palestine.

	Over the past months, UCLA has chosen to further militarize the campus and criminalize speech and political activity instead of withdrawing its support for Israeli human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
	Despite threats from pro-genocide agitators and from UCLA police, students of conscience at UCLA remain committed to calling on their university to divest from the Israeli military which is destroying life in Gaza."---Was the encampment deemed "unsafe?" Or was it interfering with operations? What is the Robinson/Edley policy on civil disobedience? What does the ACLU lawsuit say about negotiating with a protest? (There's policy on it). The encampments are "unsafe" because they attract harassers. 

	- [Video of non-affiliate](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBfBe0Gg2SW/?hl=en&img_index=1) saying, "what's up faggot, take off your mask" as he tears down the structure and the [same video posted by SJP](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBawEEKR-EF/?hl=en&img_index=6)

		- These were completely peaceful circumstances

		- There have been no comments from Braziel, the Chancellor, or Osako

- [Daily Bruin up-to-min coverage](https://dailybruin.com/2024/10/21/live-graduate-students-for-justice-in-palestine-demonstration)

	- "8:12 p.m.---Around 30 counter-protesters arrived in Dickson Court North and began to heckle pro-Palestine protesters. In response, pro-Palestine protesters attempted to form a line to prevent them from accessing the sukkah."

	- The arrested was referred to as a "demonstrator," is presumed a pro-Palestinian demonstrator

	- "3:05 p.m. – Chabad at UCLA and Alpha Epsilon Pi also set up a sukkah in Bruin Plaza on Monday morning. A fire marshal from UCFD did not respond to a request for comment as to whether that temporary structure is a fire hazard – which UCFD declared the sukkah in Dickson Court North to be."

		- Bruin Plaza is an approved area for public expression, not sure how that relates to fire code, but the Sukkahs were on the wrong side of Dickson Court

### True disruptions to campus operations 

- Encampment blockading 

	- Reddit---people can't get to class, their jobs, disabled people are denied access to campus

- The marching through the halls with chants of "From the River to the Sea" (TikTok)

	- [Pro-Palestinian protesters took over UCLA's Dodd Hall](https://www.tiktok.com/@journalistjeremy/video/7372692453956062507)

- The screen that UCLA permitted to stay without permit 

	- Reddit quote

	- [Hillel comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HqCOvk9-i0iW2xlYqvjQGyzjWDmIzjn/view), "There is a screen placed by community members at UCLA playing the horrors of October 7th on repeat--and we
	can’t learn over the constant noise of Jews being slaughtered. The wider community is prioritizing their own idea of
	activism over what Jewish students want. We want peace and a diplomatic resolution."
