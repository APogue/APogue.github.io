- “To establish a violation of Title VI under the hostile environment theory, OCR must find that: (1) a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin existed; (2) the recipient had actual or constructive notice of the hostile environment; and (3) the recipient failed to take prompt and effective action to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile environment and its effects, and prevent the harassment from recurring.” (from UMich Resolution Letter doc)

- By "[constellation of circumstances](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-11-02/pdf/00-27910.pdf)" 

	"Under Davis, determining whether harassment is actionable ‘‘depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships’’"

### Title VI 

- [Case Processing Manual](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocrcpm.pdf)


- [CFR 100.6d Compliance information](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-I/part-100/section-100.6)

	- "Information to beneficiaries and participants.  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this regulation and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible Department official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this regulation."

### The case for an overhaul of Title VI in general 

- The goal is to cast doubt, which means make it impossible to disprove the possibility that civil rights violations that equate to denied access to education are occurring 

#### The "institution side" of the loop is broken

- Based on the last year, it is impossible to say that the current standard for Title VI is working, we know that with respect to antisemitic and anti-Muslim activity

- Michigan is an example of the schools themselves not knowing Title VI 

	- Decentralized reporting with little to no accountability

	- Difficulty deciphering between creation of a hostile environment and protected speech

#### The "student side" of the loop is broken

- *Based on these issues why would we assume it is working at all?* 

- The law is vague with respect to what constitutes "protection of rights"

	- It largely relies on the student to protect themselves

	- But the student cannot be relied upon to be *aware and proactive* without, at the very least, notification and literacy

- Thus, there is no way to determine whether low reporting is due to a low number of incidents or a broken system



### A case for Title VI education

- Title VI education in general is still optional 

	- UCLA does it at orientation which is a huge cognitive burden for students

- The new laws for educating put in place by CA make Muslim education "optional"

- Block's promise to congress focused on time, place, manner

- Longevity: these issues will persist indefinitely---due to geopolitical conflict, the vitriolic political climate, foreign students, unfettered access to bias and discriminatory views via social media, and bullying and harassment via social media---and will serve to fill the void in the absence of administrative guidance and Title VI education and enforcement



## Broader Impact and Data

- Task force report indicates

	- While this information would be helpful it does not survey enough students across identities 

- UCUES indicates 

	- Surveys (Title VI and Title IX) should be separate, and mandatory

		- UCUES is too long and covers too much at once

	- 2014 https://sairo.ucla.edu/file/2563a13b-6aff-4e3a-9510-846758f78edc

	- https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Saugher-Nojan-2019-2020-Fellowship-Research-Infographic-1.pdf

	- Student surveys are a weak representation of the student body

		- They are voluntary

- Where the UC's have not seen data improvement, they sought to change the way data was gathered rather than reform the Title VI feedback cycle

	- Important questions have been made optional

	- Prior to being optional UCUES indicates

		- Discrimination issues persist

		- Students don't know how to report

			- Students post grievances on social media because they are accustomed to being "ignored" and they don't understand the accountability systems

			- A reason why constructive notice exists

### Call to Action: 

- Highlight the need for stronger independent oversight and policy changes to ensure accountability

	- The OCR office continues to shrink and is little more than a complaint box 

		- House committee hearing 

	- The OCR tolerance thresholds need to be re-examined

		- Dear colleague letters 

	- Open OCR cases against UCLA

		- Several cases have been pending while incidents keep happening

	- Like Title IX, Title VI should be expanded, and mandatory
