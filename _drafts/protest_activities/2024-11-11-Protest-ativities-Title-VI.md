### Title VI 

- [Case Processing Manual](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocrcpm.pdf)


- [CFR 100.6d Compliance information](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-I/part-100/section-100.6)

	- "Information to beneficiaries and participants.  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this regulation and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible Department official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this regulation."




### The case for an overhaul of Title VI in general 

- The goal is to cast doubt, which means make it impossible to disprove the possibility that civil rights violations that equate to denied access to education are occurring 

#### The "institution side" of the loop is broken

- Based on the last year, it is impossible to say that the current standard for Title VI is working, we know that with respect to antisemitic and anti-Muslim activity

- Michigan is an example of the schools themselves not knowing Title VI 

	- Decentralized reporting with little to no accountability

	- Difficulty deciphering between creation of a hostile environment and protected speech

#### The "student side" of the loop is broken

- *Based on these issues why would we assume it is working at all?* 

- The law is vague with respect to what constitutes "protection of rights"

	- It largely relies on the student to protect themselves

	- But the student cannot be relied upon to be *aware and proactive* without, at the very least, notification and literacy

- Thus, there is no way to determine whether low reporting is due to a low number of incidents or a broken system



### A case for Title VI education

- Longevity: these issues will persist indefinitely---due to geopolitical conflict, the vitriolic political climate, foreign students, unfettered access to bias and discriminatory views via social media, and bullying and harassment via social media---and will serve to fill the void in the absence of administrative guidance and Title VI education and enforcement
