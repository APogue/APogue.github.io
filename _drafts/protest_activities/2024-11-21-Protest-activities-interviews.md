### To any student
I don't know why I'm so surprised by the muted response to some incidents that occurred or the lack of response from the university or the greater community, I myself was very surprised by some of the admin statements, or that a study may conclude bias is occurring at UCLA. I suppose my "unique" reaction could be dismissed as naivete, maybe I don't know "how the world works," but my opinion really doesn't matter. The opinion of the people directly affected by this administration matters. Do you believe, if bias is occurring at UCLA, that it should just be dismissed? And more importantly, if you knew this is how you or your peers would be treated, would you still have chosen to come to UCLA?


### To one side or the other

The community or certain stakeholders might expect certain rhetoric from the university, whether it's not a neutral approach to administrating, or goes beyond that can't be known for sure. It is possible though, outside of negligence, a certain focus on protecting some groups while condemning others is expected. Maybe the unwillingness to condemn non-affiliates is also expected. 

Do you believe the university is listening to you, the student, you the participant in the campus culture, when they conduct themselves this way? In other words, violence aside, assuming that was not intentional, but that partial treatment was, how do you feel about that? Would you really care if the university went out of its way to advocate for inclusivity for everyone, and condemn antisemitism and anti-Muslim behavior equally? If it isn't for you, who do you believe the university does it for? How does it make you feel as a student, that your voice isn't being heard?


### Sergio Olmos

LAPD reported that they did not have sufficient personnel on hand to intervene until 2:45 am on May 1st. Would you agree with this statement? 


### JVP (Benjamin Kersten)

- Why doesn't JVP interact with CAC? 

- Do you know what the conditions were for access to the encampment, like when someon "vouched" for someone to enter? 

- Did JVP support encampment blockading, if so, why?

- How do you define Zionism? 

### Hillel (Bella)

- Some universities have explored incident-responsive restorative dialogue as a way to address harm and rebuild trust between student communities after tense or discriminatory events. Do you think that’s something you or your peers at Hillel would be open to participating in—when appropriate—or is there more comfort in addressing incidents within your own community or through parallel processes—like holding your own community discussions, working directly with administrators, or issuing statements separately—without engaging directly with groups on the other side of the conflict?

    Do you see potential value in cross-community conversations after major campus incidents, or is the priority right now more about internal safety and healing?

- [3rd party IG post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4yVx9crpDa/), knowing this was endorsed by SJP and UCLA Divest, did incidents like this cause fear among Jewish students (this feels like a leading question, based on my hypothesis)

- Was the petition to have Verdugo impeached acknowledged by anyone on campus

- Have USAC members ignored calls for diplomacy with Hillel?

    - Has she or any other Jewish members of UCLA filed a Judicial Board petition before? Specifically referring to the [UCLA BIPAC message](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3a68r6uAHC/?igsh=ZWMyNDBlOTQyNg%3D%3D&img_index=3)

    - There was a recall petition, but did they go through any of the appropriate channels? 

    - She mentioned "the university doing nothing," had they submitted reports about CAC to the university before?

    “I have every reason to believe, based on these numbers – as well as the quotes we have from Verdugo – that our perceived associations with Zionism were attached to our Jewish faith, and we were rejected,” Brannon said.

    "In the memorandum granting the petition, Venkatesh said the board will formally consider whether Verdugo violated Article I, Section E of the USA Bylaws, which prevents USAC from supporting or being affiliated with “any organization which legally discriminates on the basis of: race, creed, sex (except as exempt from Title IX), age, national origin, religion, physical handicap, or sexual orientation.”"

### The Daily Bruin (Catherine Hamilton)



### UCPD (Chief John Thomas)

1. ““As altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. He could not recall exactly when that occurred, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to secure their assistance.”

    Tracking Newsroom updates this sounds like April 30th?

2. The report from 21 solutions indicates that UCPD were made aware of the April 28th permit. 

    The LAPD report states that UCPD and mutual aid partners were able to clear clashing counter-protesters that day. Was deescalation possible due to more advanced notice? 


### SJP (Mohammed) 

- [UC Policy on prohibited conduct](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/1001004/Anti-Discrimination)

    ask about d. Other Inquiry 

### UCLA Faculty 

- Robin D.G. Kelley

- Myers 

- Graeir 


### People hurt or arrested in protests

- Catherine Washington 



- Thistle Boosinger


### Myers

- Based on these lawsuits, has antisemitism in the last year been different than other years? Has it been more prevalent? 


### Asil Yassine

“I don’t think the arrests will lead to charges against me but the cases are still in limbo over my head,” Yassine said. “But the degree issue will set back my license by at least six months.”---What does this mean, she was not conferred in June, 2024? In other words even if the degree is delayed, if she is retroactively conferred in June then her license shouldn't be delayed. 

What are the outcomes of the two arrests? 

###  Saree Makdisi <makdisi@humnet.ucla.edu>

- Held the Kaplan teach-in and contacted UCLA admin over the harassment incident
