### Sergio Olmos

LAPD reported that they did not have sufficient personnel on hand to intervene until 2:45 am on May 1st. Would you agree with this statement? 


### JVP (Benjamin Kersten)

- Why doesn't JVP interact with CAC? 

### Hillel (Bella)

- Have USAC members ignored calls for diplomacy with Hillel?

    "LOS ANGELES - The union that represents police officers at University of California schools has blamed UCLA administrators for the "lack of response" to violence that broke out at pro-Palestine student protests on campus this week, and said that any investigation into the issue should be independent."

    I think she's off in terms of the weighting of fault wrt police compared to administration, I think they largely faulted the administration in the 21 report.

    "In a statement of support for Thomas, the UC police union president said Thursday the university showed a “glaring lack of accountability among UCLA administrators for the disorganized and ineffective response to last spring’s campus protests.”

    “The UCLA administration owns the failure of any protest response, and the public should reject their attempts to shift blame to law enforcement,” said Wade Stern, president of the Federated University Peace Officers Assn., which represents more than 250 police officers at the University of California’s 10 campuses.

    “Shockingly, only former UCLA PD Chief John Thomas faced consequences, while Chancellor Gene Block retired without accountability, and others remain in leadership,” the statement said. “Chief Thomas, a dedicated leader, deserves far better than to be scapegoated for the administration’s repeated failures and poor decision-making.”

    Stern noted that a UC independent review found that UCLA administrators had excluded campus police from some meetings and ordered officers to remain out of sight and to refrain from preventing students from bringing in barriers and equipment for their pro-Palestinian encampment."

    - The "UC independent review," is of course not "independent."

- [Thomas left UCLA PD on Dec 10th](https://youtu.be/_hj6B2MpVaM?si=Xg84wlIRqA1LNxqr)

    - No news on whether he was fired or he quit (judging from the 21 report that just came out I could see why he might have quit)

    - All headlines (including the DB) are critical of Thomas. Only Wade Stern has stood up for him. 

    - This video has clear footage from April 30th, the row of police doing "nothing" from one source

    - It also has footage from another source of what looks like bear spray being used (did UCLA even update its policy?)

1. ““As altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. He could not recall exactly when that occurred, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to secure their assistance.”

    Tracking Newsroom updates this sounds like April 30th?

2. The report from 21 solutions indicates that UCPD were made aware of the April 28th permit. 

    The LAPD report states that UCPD and mutual aid partners were able to clear clashing counter-protesters that day. Was deescalation possible due to more advanced notice?

### Myers

- Based on these lawsuits, has antisemitism in the last year been different than other years? Has it been more prevalent? 


### Asil Yassine

“I don’t think the arrests will lead to charges against me but the cases are still in limbo over my head,” Yassine said. “But the degree issue will set back my license by at least six months.”---What does this mean, she was not conferred in June, 2024? In other words even if the degree is delayed, if she is retroactively conferred in June then her license shouldn't be delayed. 

What are the outcomes of the two arrests?
