### Sergio Olmos

LAPD reported that they did not have sufficient personnel on hand to intervene until 2:45 am on May 1st. Would you agree with this statement? 


### JVP (Benjamin Kersten)

- Why doesn't JVP interact with CAC? 

### Hillel (Bella)

- Have USAC members ignored calls for diplomacy with Hillel? 

### The Daily Bruin (Catherine Hamilton)



### UCPD (Chief John Thomas)

1. ““As altercations at the encampment began to increase, Thomas acknowledged that campus leadership changed direction and authorized him to supplement UCLA police and private security with increased external law enforcement, saying overtime would be paid. He could not recall exactly when that occurred, but he said he immediately contacted the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to secure their assistance.”

    Tracking Newsroom updates this sounds like April 30th?

2. The report from 21 solutions indicates that UCPD were made aware of the April 28th permit. 

    The LAPD report states that UCPD and mutual aid partners were able to clear clashing counter-protesters that day. Was deescalation possible due to more advanced notice? 


### SJP (Mohammed) 



### UCLA Faculty 


- Myers 

- Graeir 


### People hurt or arrested in protests

- Catherine Washington 



- Thistle Boosinger


### Myers

- Based on these lawsuits, has antisemitism in the last year been different than other years? Has it been more prevalent? 


### Asil Yassine

“I don’t think the arrests will lead to charges against me but the cases are still in limbo over my head,” Yassine said. “But the degree issue will set back my license by at least six months.”---What does this mean, she was not conferred in June, 2024? In other words even if the degree is delayed, if she is retroactively conferred in June then her license shouldn't be delayed. 

What are the outcomes of the two arrests?
