Oct 9th 

"In a council meeting two days after the horrific October 7th terrorist attack, Jewish students shared how they had been affected, including students sharing that their loved ones were murdered."

"there is so much propaganda that those are quote-unquote Israelis, those are settlers."

Oct 9th

On the same day as the council meeting, the Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA posted on their official Instagram profile. The first line of the post read, "The Cultural Affairs Commission of UCLA stands in solidarity with Palestinians in their struggle for liberation from Israel." It also stated, "We also stand on the grounds that decolonization is not a metaphor. **Thus, we honor the Palestinians on the frontlines taking their land and sovereignty back!**"

On that same day, Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA posted on Instagram, "Emergency Teach-In On The Crisis in Palestine." "UCLA Professors Makdisi and Razack will be convening a teach-in Wednesday, October 11th both online and in person. **If you are a student seeking more clarity, information, and perspectives on recent escalations in Palestine, we highly encourage you to attend.**"

"I'm going to rip your fucking head off

You motherfucker

You better fucking run from me terrorist"

“Only six days ago, a heinous assault was perpetrated upon Israeli civilians by the terror organization 
Hamas, a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly as well as the taking of innocent hostages. Earlier this week, I joined UC leadership in condemning this attack, and as new details have emerged, I can only denounce it further: This was a grievous act of malice and hate. It was, I am pained to say, the largest one-day killing of Jews since the end of the Holocaust.

Since then, Israel has responded to the assault, **leading to a significant loss of Palestinian lives 
and the troubling displacement of large numbers of innocent individuals.**”

“This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many 
intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand 
firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. 
I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, 
but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. 

**We must not devolve into violating 
one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment 
should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or 
threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911.**”

Oct 13th

Within hours discussions began.

"**How can we believe that the UC cares about both Palestinian lives and Israeli lives**, if the 
chancellor puts out this statement. "Grievous" "malice" "despicable" vs. "troubling". Are you joking?"

"They do care about all lives. However not denouncing Hamas when it's a well known terrorist group 
and a religious extremist group would be disgusting."

"You're directing attention away from the point. They denounced Hamas. I never said they shouldn't 
do so. However, they DID NOT denounce the ethnic cleansing that's been ensuing since. That's the point. 
I'm convinced you're choosing to be dense rn."

Oct 16

"In Chancellor Gene Block's recent statement via mass email, the UC perpetuates Zionist rhetoric by 
justifying the brutal occupation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, naming the Zionist 
regime's genocidal attacks on Gaza as simply a response to "terrorist" attacks. **However, we know 
that Al-Aqsa Flood is not unprovoked.** It is a response to over 75 years of brutal Zionist 
colonization, occupation, ethnic cleansing, the denial of Palestinian refugees' right to return 
to their ancestral homeland, relentless attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque, and indiscriminate bombardment."

Nov 19th

In a Daily Bruin article,'Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus', published on Nov 19th, 

"**Benjamin Kersten, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace at UCLA** – a coalition of Jewish students who support Palestinian liberation – said he thinks it is important to distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. However, they added that they and their organization believe that **Jewish grief is being used as a justification for oppression in the Gaza Strip.**

“There’s been a lot of repression on campus and a lot of claims that criticism of the state of Israel or that anti-Zionism is antisemitic,” Kersten said. “We’re here to very soundly say that that’s not the case. **We’re loud and proud anti-Zionist Jews** who feel very rooted in our Jewishness and in our values of equality and justice.”"

The same Bruin article featuring Benjamin's theory brought up an incident that occurred 10 days before,

Nov 8th

"At a Nov. 8 rally in support of Palestine, which was hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine and UC Divest Coalition at UCLA, participants were invited to destroy piñatas with pictures of United States President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on them."

As participants crowded around a pinata of Netanyahu an individual holding a megaphone yelled,

"Beat that fucking Jew!"

Nov 10th 

"Today, I joined University of California President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors in issuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses — including UCLA — over the past several weeks. We must be crystal clear: discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding."

"At an event just this week on our campus, individuals exhibited extremely hateful behavior and used despicable Antisemitic language, which was captured on video and shared widely, frightening many within our community. **While this may be protected speech under the First Amendment**, it is nonetheless abhorrent and completely unacceptable. **Campus officials are reviewing the actions at the event and anyone found to be in violation of the law or the UCLA code of conduct will be held accountable.**"

Nov 19th

In a Daily Bruin article,'Students voice worries over Islamophobia on UCLA campus', also published on Nov 19th, a Palestinian student stated

"that they feel **the administration is at least in part to blame for inciting violence on campus** because it has seemed to support Jewish students in its statements more than Palestinian students.”" 

Dec 5th

Another Bruin article, **'UCLA faces scrutiny for safety issues at protests for Israel, Palestine,'** dated Dec 5th, brought attention to allegations made by CAC after a rally in support of Israel on Nov. 7th in an Instagram post.

The post echoed the student's sentiment from the earlier article. 

“Just today, students were selling Kuffiyas on campus on Bruinwalk when older non-students started shoving them. Throughout the day, non-students harassed, threatened, and assaulted BIPOC students, and nothing was done by campus security teams—including UCPD. More than ever, it is clear that there is no safety for…students supporting Palestine on campus. **UCLA has still not released even a statement to acknowledge, let alone condemn the hate crimes, harassment, and violence students have faced for years.**

We call on UCLA, the UC, and other entities of this institution to protect students from **the violence that is waged by both students and non-students on your own campuses**. We call on campus resources to be more accessible to students facing imminent and indirect danger from Islamophobic, Zionist, and anti-Palestinian violence.”

Oct 25th

At a walkout march on Oct 25th, 

“Several speakers brought attention to recent allegations of attacks against pro-Palestinian students on campus."

When the Daily Bruin inquired about the allegations, in an emailed statement a UCLA spokesperson

"said members of the student affairs team intervened in response to students at Kaplan Hall allegedly experiencing harassment while attempting to watch a teach-in on their computers. The spokesperson added that the university is still investigating the incident with an eye to holding individuals in violation of university rules and the law accountable.

“While we don’t believe the individuals who caused the incident are students or affiliated with our campus, **we strongly encourage all community members to engage in thoughtful debate and treat everyone with respect**,” they said in the statement.”"

Oct 12

Hillel at UCLA, the largest Jewish campus organization at UCLA, posted a statement on their Instagram account.

"There are reports of some incidents in the last few days where students of different backgrounds and views have been harassed or intimidated. This is not acceptable and Hillel believes there is NO justification for any type of aggression towards any students.  

We also call on agitators in the outside communities to stay away from campus. **Your acts of aggression---no matter what your views are---are not welcome at UCLA. We know that many of the reported incidents were caused by non-students and we condemn them in the strongest terms**. 

The conflict between Israel and Hamas does not need to spill over and poison our campus. We all mourn. Hate at UCLA will never be the answer."

In the weeks following Oct 7th, the "marketplace of emotion" was flooded with grief, understandably so.

Would the statement made by Hillel such a short time after Oct 7th, recognizing Palestinian grief be considered popular? In the "marketplace of ideas" we know truth can be denied because it is unpopular. 

The question must be raised, were matters between student groups being managed in a content-neutral fashion, or did the administration also subscribe to this marketplace? In other words, did some students "have what was coming to them" based on who they were or what they believed?
