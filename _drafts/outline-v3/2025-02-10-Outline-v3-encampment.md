The key theme is deliberate indifference 

- distinguish between ignorance and willful ignorance 

	- willful ignorance became its own problem and endangered students

- Willful ignorance" refers to the act of deliberately choosing to avoid information or facts that could potentially be important or damaging, essentially deciding to remain uninformed on a subject despite having the ability to learn about it; it's often used when someone actively avoids knowledge to protect themselves from facing uncomfortable truths or potential consequences. 

If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite “Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid” instead of just saying, “this was an unlawful obstruction”? 

- dog whistle? 

- they wanted to shut the encampment down 

Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways and violence) to continue for days before acting? Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?

- public perception, Irvine worked with students to make the encampments functional, it would look too hasty to shut them down immediately without trying to educate them on time, place, and manner

	- refresh on what happened with Irvine, he did call the cops on the students, but no one was hurt or arrested, and he maintained a rapport with them thereafter

- they didn't want to shut it down too soon, they were feigning free speech protections and following suit with other big universities 

Why did UCLA ignore student safety concerns about antisemitism when no laws were broken, but suddenly take those concerns seriously when laws were technically violated?

- because they did not want to address the unlawfulness 

- they did not want to assist in any way in making the encampment lawful 

UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.

- they used Jewish safety as the Trojan horse to infiltrate the encampment and shut it down 

When it came time to shut the encampment down on May 1st, there was no clear message to the university or the greater community as to why 

- do they believe the greater community only cares about Jewish students?

- regardless of how this group of students felt, they were unsafe 

	- find the info snippet on the backstory of how they were notified 

What does it mean to "feel unsafe?"

- are we defining "feeling unsafe" as bodily harm? or as exclusion? If it is the latter, then there were many instances where students would rightfully have felt unsafe

- in fact there were many instances when students said explicitly that they felt unsafe
