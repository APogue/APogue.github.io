The key theme is deliberate indifference 

- distinguish between ignorance and willful ignorance 

	- willful ignorance became its own problem and endangered students

- "Willful ignorance" refers to the act of deliberately choosing to avoid information or facts that could potentially be important or damaging, essentially deciding to remain uninformed on a subject despite having the ability to learn about it; it's often used when someone actively avoids knowledge to protect themselves from facing uncomfortable truths or potential consequences. 

If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite “Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid” instead of just saying, “this was an unlawful obstruction”? 

- dog whistle? 

- they wanted to shut the encampment down 

Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways and violence) to continue for days before acting? Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?

- public perception, Irvine worked with students to make the encampments functional, it would look too hasty to shut them down immediately without trying to educate them on time, place, and manner

	- refresh on what happened with Irvine, he did call the cops on the students, but no one was hurt or arrested, and he maintained a rapport with them thereafter

- they didn't want to shut it down too soon, they were feigning free speech protections and following suit with other big universities 

Why did UCLA ignore student safety concerns about antisemitism when no laws were broken, but suddenly take those concerns seriously when laws were technically violated?

- because they did not want to address the unlawfulness 

- they did not want to assist in any way in making the encampment lawful 

UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.

- they used Jewish safety as the Trojan horse to infiltrate the encampment and shut it down 

When it came time to shut the encampment down on May 1st, there was no clear message to the university or the greater community as to why 

- do they believe the greater community only cares about Jewish students?

- regardless of how this group of students felt, they were unsafe 

	- find the info snippet on the backstory of how they were notified 

What does it mean to "feel unsafe?"

- are we defining "feeling unsafe" as bodily harm? or as exclusion? If it is the latter, then there were many instances where students would have rightfully  felt unsafe

- in fact there were many instances when students said explicitly that they felt unsafe 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This wasn't a failure of resources it was a failure in judgement 


evidence 

- evidence of violence 

- evidence of blockading 

- evidence of community involvement 

	- comms directly with the university 

	- social media 

testimony 

- students feeling unsafe pro-p

- students feeling unsafe pro-I

- SAMs

communications 

- students

- newsroom (mary osako)

- Gene Block

- Rick Braziel 

- politicians 

- Irvine chancellor

- internal professor 

- external professor

- LAPD

accountability and policy

- arrests

- student conduct hearings 

- change in policies 

- blame game and firings

- Jewish task force

- Muslim/Arab task force 

- congressional hearing 

- DEI training data

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I need to develop and build to some kind of crescendo when it comes to the comparison of safety and policy as a function of time

"safety," or lack thereof presents itself as 

- USAC policy 

- discrimination 

- violence 

- exclusion 

14th amendment and title VI protections state that you can't deny access to education 

- by blockading walkways large swaths of people were denied access to areas of campus and had to take detours to get to their classes

	- that's enough to say if it wasn't breaking Title VI or 14th amendment, that at the least they were breaking the time, place and manner laws 

	- they were not literally denying anyone access to an education 

- if people are violently harassed and/or sent to the hospital as a result of failures of UCLA policy

	- they are literally being denied access to their education 

- look at it in a purely content neutral way, rhetoric meant to make some number of students feel "safe" led to a larger number of students being made physically unsafe 

UCLA maintains a policy of 

- willful ignorance 

- heavy policing 

	- policing has always been a "point and shoot" tool

	- they never expected UCPD to handle policy 

	- they did when riots broke out 

- communications to the Jewish community 

- blame

- absent rhetoric 

	- they don't want to be seen as assisting any cause in any way

		- whether assistance is in the form of ideological promotion (the cover)

		- or assisting in stopping the nuisance that protests created 

		- or protection of student safety 

timeline 

- start at the encampment arrests

- backwards in time to the first half of the school year up to the start of the encampment

- crescendo at the violence at encampment 

- policing after encampment 

- forwards in time to June 10th protests and policing 

antisemitism

- Whose fault is it that antisemitism is happening on campus?

- It becomes a question of how much antisemitism is happening because the school is not enforcing policy

	- Forget whether its incumbent upon the students to initiate impeachment hearings

	- These students pay student fees to the school 

	- Are we throwing out the baby with the bathwater because honestly no one wants the baby either?

- JVP never interacted with CAC

	- JVP has been bullied and harassed 

	- This JVP is very different from Michigan, they are not radical, they do not push violent or hateful rhetoric

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don’t want to start with the night that already got the most media coverage. Instead, I want to frame the reader’s mindset so that by the time they reach the riot, they fully grasp the institutional failures that led to it.

Frame the Core Themes (Safety vs. Policy Over Time)

Events leading up to the encampment clearing - students were clearly denying students access to education by blockading pathways thereby breaking laws corresponding to time, place and manner rules, but Block framed it as a safety issue. 

Block made it clear in that moment his priority was to make the campus environment "safe" for all students

Did UCLA’s policies and decision-making create a safer campus?

Tell a story, from start to finish there should be three developing arcs:

The Policy Arc: when was policy clearly applied or not clearly applied when it should have been 

- formal policies on speech, protest and discrimination

The decision Arc: What were the decisions

- enacted in a reactive, selective, and deliberately vague way 

The results: what actually happened 

- campus safety was never a first priority for any student

- campus was not equally safe for all students

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the overall Arc: 

something has to lead up to violence, what is the arc that leads up to violence? 

demonstrate a clear cause and effect, ucla was a catalyst for the ultimate firestorm 

- UCLA policy and decisions led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results left unattended led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results lead to violence 

- violence lead to blame, denial, and tone deaf policy

- blame, denial and tone deaf policy led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results led to denial of education  

- and round and round it goes 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
outside/inside 

before a scenario and after

scenario and similar flashback 

cause and effect map 

## Big incidents


### The Kaplan incident violence arc 

- They're aware of misinformation spreading through the community -> posts on Twitter and death threats to English Dept. 

	- They're aware of the vast Jewish and pro-Israel connection with UCLA social media channels -> UCLA even posted ahead of the meeting to try to dispel rumors

- Even despite their best efforts to address "rumors" that did not change the violent outcome

	- It was the English Dept that opted to use an abundance of caution and move the teach in. 

- They witnessed the effect -> violence shown to students, and one parent

- Their solution had nothing to do with holding perpetrators accountable      

### The encampment violence arc

- they were aware of the blockading 

	- this became a big deal within the community (NY Times)

- they were aware of the violence 

- they did nothing for days 

- emboldened (the guy with the message on his phone), that was on April 30th, he was clearly not deterred because of days of chaos were allowed to continue the days before 

- they sent a message to the community about the harm it was causing, choosing to say Jewish students were "afraid."

- they did not choose to publicly address the encampment, however the encampment did publicly respond 

- Gene claimed it was due to security issues (congressional hearing), that's why he wanted to shut it down that day, but he never stated that to the students, and never bothered to warn them when they released the statement that they would stay

- there's also a video capture of someone saying "this is for blocking students and making them afraid" (reddit)

### The Sukkah for Gaza arc 


## UCLA upholds a "policy" of one-way communication 

- Media attention is driving responses

	- The independent report confirmed this 

- reaction to encampment conduct made publicly, and directed at students

- reaction to pinata incident made publicly and directed at students 

- reaction to pig effigy made publicly and directed at students 

- reaction to June 10th protest

- at no point was there ever an explicit reaction to counterprotesters 

	- after the kaplan event

	- or during the April protest







### UCLA is allowing students to violate policy under the guise of free speech protections

- Some free speech and academic freedom policy here? 

- Factor that in against Title VI and 14th Amendment 

- Students, and the community want to see measures taken to indicate the administration is listening and not just acting when the spotlight is on them 

	- The school is not taking positive voices from within the community and promoting them 

		- Why didn't they stand with Hillel in condemning the Kaplan incident? 

		- Title VI and that policy doc encourages UCLA's input to the marketplace of ideas

	- Survey - no one trusts the administration 

- How can students feel safe if they don't feel the university is monitoring incidents or listening to them?

### Jewish Students Call for Administrative Help from UCLA - the Call Goes Unanswered 

- When USAC began excluding it was clear they were compromised 

	- Jewish students called out the exclusion (winter)

	- It goes against school policy to exclude

	- Jewish students pay student fees, USAC uses these fees 

- Evidence against (CAC) continued to pile up, how much needed to accumulate? (flashback to post-Oct 7th incident)

	- X posts

	- Hostile environment by totality of circumstances 

- Jewish students had to take it upon themselves; it was clear that CAC was compromised when verdugo stepped down

	- But they called for her impeachment earlier (petition)

	- It was an impeachable offense to be in the encampment

	- Based on no condemnations by USAC for any antisemitic behavior on campus, or for blockading or any behavior breaking the rules, it was clear they weren't going to address issues 

	- Yet Jewish students didn't manage to begin the hearing process until the following academic year, after Verdugo had been voted in again by the student body 

		- Jewish students don't even have the representation necessary to change voting outcomes

		- Why are such extreme measures necessary when behavior is clearly violating policy? 

- The university didn't bother to weed out bad apples, which served to inflame tensions between student factions (Eli Tsives, who mentioned Verdugo by name) 

	- While at the same time, counterprotesters were not addressed, putting ALL protesting students in serious danger 

		- The person's quote saying that the encampment "had it coming"

### Encampment Notifications by UCLA 

- If not incumbent on the university to uphold policy, then it was at least incumbent on them to warn students of the danger that they were in (like some sort of disclaimer)

	- Block sent a campus-wide statement saying that the encampment made students feel threatened and afraid

	- Gene Block told the House Committee that security issues were why they cleared the encampment 

	- At no point was there a public, campus-wide notice addressing protesting students for the sake of danger mitigation

		- Title IX addresses posting and notification requirements, as opposed to Title VI where information need only be "made available," a lower standard for safety, communication of the law, and protection of rights. UCLA opted to make information available to protesting students without concern that only a subset of protesting students may be getting this information  

		- There was an unclear message in the form of a flyer that students needed to leave 

			- There was no clear message that students were engaging in unlawful obstruction or were in immediate danger

			- Because the message was not campus-wide, only a subset of students were guaranteed to have received it

		- Students groups responded by saying "we will not leave"

			- It should have been clear to UCLA (via constructive notice) that the encampment would not be vacated that evening

			- If they had really intended on having the encampment cleared, and they knew that it would not be, why not take further administrative or security steps to address the encampment? 

				- Because they chose deliberate indifference to the situation 

					- They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the status of their own students

					- They chose to be deliberately indifferent to the lack of police presence and backup that would be available to them 

- It was incumbent on the university to notify students that they would be facing arrest

	- There was no clear message that continuing to camp on university grounds would result in arrest

		- Students within the encampment were told the afternoon before, in-person 

		- The encampment was ambushed in the middle of the night 

			- There is no guarantee that all encampment students had adequate warning to leave or be arrested 

			- Police conduct was not lawful and put students in danger 

			- I do not know if arrests were indiscriminate, I have to check that 

				- Because it has been the case before that students were kettled without an appropriate dispersal order

## Policing 

### police response regents meeting 

### police response April 28th 

### police response April 29th 

### police response encampment 

### Office of campus safety created

### police response June 10th 

## SAMs

### Kaplan incident 

### The encampment

### the 3rd party investigation 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Heavy policing is already a policy of the university 

- Open with an arresting scene - drop the reader into the moment of peak chaos. Use vivid descriptions, eyewitness accounts, and specific details to establish the stakes.

- Did they arrest indiscriminately, or was there a fair dispersal order?
