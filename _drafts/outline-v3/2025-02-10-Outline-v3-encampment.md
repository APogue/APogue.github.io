The key theme is deliberate indifference 

- distinguish between ignorance and willful ignorance 

	- willful ignorance became its own problem and endangered students

- "Willful ignorance" refers to the act of deliberately choosing to avoid information or facts that could potentially be important or damaging, essentially deciding to remain uninformed on a subject despite having the ability to learn about it; it's often used when someone actively avoids knowledge to protect themselves from facing uncomfortable truths or potential consequences. 

If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite “Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid” instead of just saying, “this was an unlawful obstruction”? 

- dog whistle? 

- they wanted to shut the encampment down 

Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways and violence) to continue for days before acting? Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?

- public perception, Irvine worked with students to make the encampments functional, it would look too hasty to shut them down immediately without trying to educate them on time, place, and manner

	- refresh on what happened with Irvine, he did call the cops on the students, but no one was hurt or arrested, and he maintained a rapport with them thereafter

- they didn't want to shut it down too soon, they were feigning free speech protections and following suit with other big universities 

Why did UCLA ignore student safety concerns about antisemitism when no laws were broken, but suddenly take those concerns seriously when laws were technically violated?

- because they did not want to address the unlawfulness 

- they did not want to assist in any way in making the encampment lawful 

UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.

- they used Jewish safety as the Trojan horse to infiltrate the encampment and shut it down 

When it came time to shut the encampment down on May 1st, there was no clear message to the university or the greater community as to why 

- do they believe the greater community only cares about Jewish students?

- regardless of how this group of students felt, they were unsafe 

	- find the info snippet on the backstory of how they were notified 

What does it mean to "feel unsafe?"

- are we defining "feeling unsafe" as bodily harm? or as exclusion? If it is the latter, then there were many instances where students would have rightfully  felt unsafe

- in fact there were many instances when students said explicitly that they felt unsafe 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This wasn't a failure of resources it was a failure in judgement 


evidence 

- evidence of violence 

- evidence of blockading 

- evidence of community involvement 

	- comms directly with the university 

	- social media 

testimony 

- students feeling unsafe pro-p

- students feeling unsafe pro-I

- SAMs

communications 

- students

- newsroom (mary osako)

- Gene Block

- Rick Braziel 

- politicians 

- Irvine chancellor

- internal professor 

- external professor

- LAPD

accountability and policy

- arrests

- student conduct hearings 

- change in policies 

- blame game and firings

- Jewish task force

- Muslim/Arab task force 

- congressional hearing 

- DEI training data

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I need to develop and build to some kind of crescendo when it comes to the comparison of safety and policy as a function of time

"safety," or lack thereof presents itself as 

- USAC policy 

- discrimination 

- violence 

- exclusion 

14th amendment and title VI protections state that you can't deny access to education 

- by blockading walkways large swaths of people were denied access to areas of campus and had to take detours to get to their classes

	- that's enough to say if it wasn't breaking Title VI or 14th amendment, that at the least they were breaking the time, place and manner laws 

	- they were not literally denying anyone access to an education 

- if people are violently harassed and/or sent to the hospital as a result of failures of UCLA policy

	- they are literally being denied access to their education 

- look at it in a purely content neutral way, rhetoric meant to make some number of students feel "safe" led to a larger number of students being made physically unsafe 

UCLA maintains a policy of 

- willful ignorance 

- heavy policing 

	- policing has always been a "point and shoot" tool

	- they never expected UCPD to handle policy 

	- they did when riots broke out 

- communications to the Jewish community 

- blame

- absent rhetoric 

	- they don't want to be seen as assisting any cause in any way

		- whether assistance is in the form of ideological promotion (the cover)

		- or assisting in stopping the nuisance that protests created 

		- or protection of student safety 

timeline 

- start at the encampment arrests

- backwards in time to the first half of the school year up to the start of the encampment

- crescendo at the violence at encampment 

- policing after encampment 

- forwards in time to June 10th protests and policing 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don’t want to start with the night that already got the most media coverage. Instead, I want to frame the reader’s mindset so that by the time they reach the riot, they fully grasp the institutional failures that led to it.

Frame the Core Themes (Safety vs. Policy Over Time)

Events leading up to the encampment clearing - students were clearly denying students access to education by blockading pathways thereby breaking laws corresponding to time, place and manner rules, but Block framed it as a safety issue. 

Block made it clear in that moment his priority was to make the campus environment "safe" for all students

Did UCLA’s policies and decision-making create a safer campus?

Tell a story, from start to finish there should be three developing arcs:

The Policy Arc: when was policy clearly applied or not clearly applied when it should have been 

- formal policies on speech, protest and discrimination

The decision Arc: What were the decisions

- enacted in a reactive, selective, and deliberately vague way 

The results: what actually happened 

- campus safety was never a first priority for any student

- campus was not equally safe for all students

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the overall Arc: 

something has to lead up to violence, what is the arc that leads up to violence? 

demonstrate a clear cause and effect, ucla was a catalyst for the ultimate firestorm 

- UCLA policy and decisions led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results left unattended led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results lead to violence 

- violence lead to blame, denial, and tone deaf policy

- blame, denial and tone deaf policy led to unsafe results 

- unsafe results led to denial of education 

- and round and round it goes 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Heavy policing is already a policy of the university 

- Open with an arresting scene - drop the reader into the moment of peak chaos. Use vivid descriptions, eyewitness accounts, and specific details to establish the stakes.
