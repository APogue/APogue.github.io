The key theme is deliberate indifference 

- distinguish between ignorance and willful ignorance 

	- willful ignorance became its own problem and endangered students

- "Willful ignorance" refers to the act of deliberately choosing to avoid information or facts that could potentially be important or damaging, essentially deciding to remain uninformed on a subject despite having the ability to learn about it; it's often used when someone actively avoids knowledge to protect themselves from facing uncomfortable truths or potential consequences. 

If the blockade was the issue, why did UCLA cite “Jewish students feeling threatened and afraid” instead of just saying, “this was an unlawful obstruction”? 

- dog whistle? 

- they wanted to shut the encampment down 

Why did UCLA allow known unlawful acts (blockading walkways and violence) to continue for days before acting? Why did UCLA fail to issue a clear, immediate dispersal order as soon as the encampment became unlawful?

- public perception, Irvine worked with students to make the encampments functional, it would look too hasty to shut them down immediately without trying to educate them on time, place, and manner

	- refresh on what happened with Irvine, he did call the cops on the students, but no one was hurt or arrested, and he maintained a rapport with them thereafter

- they didn't want to shut it down too soon, they were feigning free speech protections and following suit with other big universities 

Why did UCLA ignore student safety concerns about antisemitism when no laws were broken, but suddenly take those concerns seriously when laws were technically violated?

- because they did not want to address the unlawfulness 

- they did not want to assist in any way in making the encampment lawful 

UCLA cited Jewish students’ safety as a primary reason to shut down the encampment—despite not acting on the same concerns earlier.

- they used Jewish safety as the Trojan horse to infiltrate the encampment and shut it down 

When it came time to shut the encampment down on May 1st, there was no clear message to the university or the greater community as to why 

- do they believe the greater community only cares about Jewish students?

- regardless of how this group of students felt, they were unsafe 

	- find the info snippet on the backstory of how they were notified 

What does it mean to "feel unsafe?"

- are we defining "feeling unsafe" as bodily harm? or as exclusion? If it is the latter, then there were many instances where students would have rightfully  felt unsafe

- in fact there were many instances when students said explicitly that they felt unsafe 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This wasn't a failure of resources it was a failure in judgement 


evidence 

- evidence of violence 

- evidence of blockading 

- evidence of community involvement 

	- comms directly with the university 

	- social media 

testimony 

- students feeling unsafe pro-p

- students feeling unsafe pro-I

- SAMs

communications 

- students

- newsroom (mary osako)

- Gene Block

- Rick Braziel 

- politicians 

- Irvine chancellor

- internal professor 

- LAPD

accountability and policy

- blame game and firings

- Jewish task force

- Muslim/Arab task force 

- encampment accountability 

- congressional hearing 

- DEI training data

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I need to develop and build to some kind of crescendo when it comes to 

- safety and policy need to be compared as a function of time

safety or lack thereof presents itself as 

- USAC policy 

- discrimination 

- violence 

- exclusion 

UCLA maintains a policy of 

- willful ignorance 

- heavy policing 

- communications to the Jewish community 

- blame

- absent rhetoric 

	- they don't want to be seen as assisting any cause in any way

		- whether assistance is in the form of ideological promotion (the cover)

		- or protection of student safety 

	- absent rhetoric exacerbating problems and leads to an unsafe environment 

		- violence

		- the rift between students

		- the nuisance that the protests were to other students/faculty/staff/parents

timeline 

- start at the start of the encampment 

- backwards in time to the first half of the school year 

- crescendo at the violence at encampment 

- policing after encampment 

- forwards in time to June 10th protests and policing 


That makes sense—you don’t want to start with the night that already got the most media coverage. Instead, you want to frame the reader’s mindset so that by the time they reach the riot, they fully grasp the institutional failures that led to it.


1. Heavy policing is already a policy of the university - Open with an Arresting Scene (Encampment Violence)

- Drop the reader into the moment of peak chaos—the violence at the encampment. Use vivid descriptions, eyewitness accounts, and specific details to establish the stakes.

2. Frame the Core Themes (Safety vs. Policy Over Time)
- Introduce the core tensions: UCLA's approach to safety vs. its policies on speech, discrimination, and policing.

- Pose the central question: Did UCLA create a safe environment, or did its policies exacerbate danger?
