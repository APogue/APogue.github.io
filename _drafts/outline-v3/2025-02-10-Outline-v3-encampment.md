Deliberate Indifference is a Recurring Institutional Failure


This Wasnâ€™t a Failure of Resources, It Was a Failure of Judgment


They were complicit in fostering an environment where exclusion was allowed to thrive


Truth can be to divide as much as for anything else. If the university saw CAC's messaging as the truth about Palestinian sentiment against Jews, then they might be politically motivated to allow it to continue 


CAC's rhetoric, while protected, garnered a lot of attention and should have been a warning about potentially exclusive practices that may likely occur. 


instance of free speech protections 


instance free speech protections 


when exclusion began, ignored 



By totality of circumstances it was becoming that the environment was becoming hostile 


again free speech allows for certain events to occur 


but they need to be on the ready for the moment exclusion begins 


and they weren't 


they allowed exclusion to go on for days when it came to the encampment 



if the encampment is in essence a jew exclusion zone, or an Israeli exclusion zone, and there's symbology within the encampment promoting antisemitic hate, then that's a real problem 

If there are certain things that are exclusionary, then they need to be addressed 




---------------------

- Rift all along between pro-p and Jewish students, school didn't do anything about that

	- the school was also aware that the greater community tracks and targets pro-p students, and even admits their knowledge by social media posts addressing the community 

- Not a surprise to anyone when they begin blockading students from accessing areas of campus, school doesn't do anything about that

	- this was a problem for working students, disabled students, jewish students, people completely uninvolved in this situation politically were dragged into conflict and denied access to areas of campus 

- Then aggravators become increasingly more aggravated, school doesn't do anything about that

	- the school should very much be aware the greater community knows the blockading is happening 

	- the school should be very much aware that counterprotester present a serious security threat, if not from the November or other calls by students for the administration's attention, then by the fights that broke out in the days before

	- yet still the school chooses inflammatory rhetoric, and to never point out who the culprits are who are causing the security threat 

- Pro-p attempts to further protect the encampment from aggravators, only increases the issue for students and increases tensions with aggravators, school doesn't do anything about that

	- in fact it assists in some cases with reinforcing barricades 

- Then when it comes time to shut the encampment down, administration is vague and cryptic, and very late, and does nothing to explain that the law is being broken and that security is now a major issue

	- really they only add fuel to the flames with more inflammatory language 

- The violent riots occur nonetheless, with police response questionable 

- This leads to a forceful takedown of the encampment and classes having to go remote, which was a major problem for parents and students alike
