“Our review of emails and other electronic communications revealed that, once the encampment was established, administrators were bombarded with questions from within and outside the UCLA community about how it planned to respond. **Particularly after social media posts about Jewish students being excluded from portions of campus went viral**, administrators were inundated with complaints and concerns from parents, politicians, and community members about why the University was allowing it to continue.”

I’ve emailed you previously with respect to UCLA and rampant antisemitism on
campus. **I am
forwarding a viral video demanding the Regents investigate and suspend and expel
these students**.
There is no privacy rights to encampments on public property. UCLA is a public
university funded by the
taxpayer. The video highlights the Regents ongoing failure to protect the safety
and security of Jewish
students.
I expect a reply and a letter to all students and members of the UCLA community
discussing this
incident, denouncing it, and reiterating UCLA commitment to the safety of its
student body.

Because you have not removed the pro Palestinian encampment from the campus,
Because you failed to identify actual UCLA students from outside agitators,
Because so many faculty members have aligned themselves with the free Palestine
group, marching with them on campus,
Because UCLA Jewish students continue to be intimidated and afraid to attend class as
the targets of hate speech,
Because Jewish students are being forced to hide off campus,
Because clearly your Arab students have crossed the line of legitimate protest,
We as donors have amended our Living Trust by removing UCLA as a financial recipient .
UCLA has now lost our multi-million dollar bequest.

They began throwing blankets and scarves over my face. They began pushing me with open palms and
body shoves. They linked arms and attempted to physically push me out of the space. | sat down to
prevent them from continuing to push me. When my older brother was two blocks away and | let the
FJP leaders know he was arriving they let me free. When my brother arrived they apologized and
claimed they did it because they thought | was an "Israeli agitator."
